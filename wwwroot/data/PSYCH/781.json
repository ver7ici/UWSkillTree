    "description": "Memory is intimately involved in most, if not all, domains of human cognition, from the ability to temporarily remember a phone number to the acquisition of language, to defining who we are.  This course will consider the cognitive and neural organization of memory, the basis of remembering and forgetting, and the nature of false memories, with an emphasis on the consequences of brain changes associated with normal and pathological aging.  Throughout, cognitive theory and behavioural evidence will be integrated with data from neuropsychology and functional brain imaging.",
