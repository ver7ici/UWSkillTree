It builds upon the foundation in assessment that students will have acquired in PSYCH 717 & 718 (Psychological Assessment I & II) and is meant to complement other developmental courses that students will have taken at the undergraduate and graduate levels coupled with child-focused clinical casework. The course includes a combination of in-class didactics and discussion coupled with supervised training and practice in commonly used ASD assessment tools.",
