    "description": "This course will provide an overview of the theory and empirical data pertaining to work motivation.  Emphasis will be placed on individual goals; specifically, the definition of goals, how goals are set and adopted, and how goal-striving unfolds over time.  Readings will highlight the dynamic, within-person nature of many motivational processes.  Special attention will be paid to formal (i.e., mathematical) theories of dynamic self-regulation.",
