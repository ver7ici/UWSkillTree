    "description": "Computations neuroscience uses mathematical and computational methods to develop, explore, and test theories and models in neuroscience.  Increasingly this approach is being applied to behavioural and cognitive questions.  This course is intended to give students with a limited mathematical and computational background a familiarity with computational methods applied to cognitive issues and to improve the ability of the student to evaluate psychological research that employs these methods.  The course will require students to perform a series of computational and programming exercises using an existing open source neural simulation software package.  (Held with PSYCH 463).",
