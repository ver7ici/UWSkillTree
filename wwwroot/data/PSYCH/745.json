    "description": "This graduate seminar will focus on theory and research in close relationships. This field is characterized by enormous breath of content, unique methodological and statistical challenges and, perhaps most importantly, the need for meta-theories around which major empirical findings can be integrated and organized. The purpose of this seminar is three fold: (1) to familiarize students with classical and contemporary theorizing in the field of close relationships; (2) to read and critique some of the best research in the field; and (3) to identify what critical questions must be asked - and eventually answered - if a more coherent and integrated science of relationships is to emerge.",
