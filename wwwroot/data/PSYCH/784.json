    "description": "The purpose of this course is to introduce students to basic aspects of anatomy and pathology in the human brain.  After completing this course, students should expect to have mastered the location of major neuroanatomic landmarks, be able to identify these landmarks on both postmortem brains and neuroradiologic films (i.e., CT scan, MRI scan), understand rudimentary brain structure-function relations, outline the gross morphological and cellular consequences of major categories of neuropathology, understand fundamental neuropathologic mechanisms associated with various brain diseases, and describe the general impact of various neuropathologic processes on cognitive and behavioural functioning.  (Offered in alternate years from PSYCH 785.)",
