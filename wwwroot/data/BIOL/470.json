    "description": "An introduction to methods used to sample and characterize the ecological structure and function of aquatic ecosystems, including basic aspects of the abiotic environment.  Field trips to lake and stream sites are combined with laboratory analysis of samples and data. While the main emphasis is on the techniques, the exercises also provide direct experience with some of the natural and anthropogenic variation observable in aquatic systems. [Note:  Formerly BIOL 460L. Field Trip fee of $60 is required toward the cost of transportation.Offered: F]",
