    "description": "The ability to determine the three\u00bfdimensional structure of a biomolecule and correlate that structure to molecular function is essential to understanding its role in Biology. In BIOL 650 we will explore the use of biophysical and structural approaches that can be used to establish the structure and function of protein-based biomolecules. The primary emphasis of the course will be upon establishing structure\u00bffunction relationships in enzymes. Upon completion of the course, students will have gained a practical understanding of the use and limitations of the tools of steady\u00bfstate enzyme kinetics and x\u00bfray crystallography.",
