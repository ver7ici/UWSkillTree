    "title": "Trenchless Technologies",
    "description": "Over the past ten years, a new group of construction methods, known as trenchless technologies, has gained widespread acceptance. Trenchless technologies include methods for installing and rehabilitating underground utility systems with minimal surface disruption and destruction that results from excavation. Underground utility systems include: water and wastewater distribution and collection systems; gas, petroleum and chemical pipelines; electrical and communications networks; access ways; and other small diameter tunnels used for a variety of applications. The objective of this course is to introduce trenchless technology methods and their importance in public works, pipeline construction, and rehabilitation. Students will be exposed to new topics and concepts through class lectures, specified readings, guest presentations, field trips, student seminars, and the completion of assignments. Topics to be covered include horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, pipeline assessment, pipe bursting, and pipeline rehabilitation and renewal techniques.",
