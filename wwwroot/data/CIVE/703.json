    "description": "Covered in this course are the major topics relating to the behaviour and design of cold formed steel structural elements and members. More specifically, the following topics will be addressed from a theoretical and design point of view: local buckling of compression elements subjected to uniform stress and stress gradient; design of flexural members, compression members, beam-columns, composite steel deck slabs and connections; diaphragm design and lightweight steel framing. The governing Canadian CSA Standard S 136 will be used as a guide document.",
