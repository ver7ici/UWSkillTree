    "description": "This course will focus on the fundamentals of pavement design, construction and management systems.  Structural behaviour of flexible and rigid pavements will be discussed in detail.  Other topics covered in the course will include: testing of pavement materials including aggregates, asphalt, concrete and various other specialized pavement materials, pavement distresses such as fatigue, rutting and temperature related cracking and the key elements to pavement management systems and their operation.  Theoretical principles are combined with practical examples of working systems that enable students to carry out various analyses of hypothetical and real life situations.",
