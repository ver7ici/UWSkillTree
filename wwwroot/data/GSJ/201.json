    "description": "From film, television and the internet to fashion magazines, computer games and music videos, popular culture is a ubiquitous part of people's lives. This course examines popular representations of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual identity, (dis)ability, class, religion, and other axes of oppression. How does popular culture reinforce norms and stereotypes that disadvantage people in virtue of their gender or other identity? How can popular culture help to address such disadvantages? At the end of the day, is popular culture a force for justice or for injustice (or both)?",
