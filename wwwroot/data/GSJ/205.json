    "description": "This course explores the interaction of gender and other axes of oppression with technology. From condoms to the internet, from vacuum cleaners to space shuttles, we will examine the ways in which the design, engineering, production, and consumption of various technologies differentially affect people based on their demographic features. We will survey feminist and other technology scholars to consider the ways in which technology can both oppress and liberate.",
