    "title": "Critical Topics in Social Work and Health",
    "description": "This is a multi-module course that introduces students to key topics in social work and health through a critical lens (e.g., gerontology, mental health, community health, etc.). Students have the option of choosing 3 modules (topics), each being 4-weeks in duration. The common theme across the modules is the critical theories that frame the examination of each module topic. Students will further develop understanding of critical theoretical frameworks and their application to contemporary health discourses and health services and systems. Each module will underscore how the critical framing of health discourses and health services and systems are engaged as a method of identifying and responding to health inequities and diverse understandings of health and illness. (Note: This is an online course).",
