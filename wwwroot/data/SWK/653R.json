    "description": "Grief is a part of the human experience that often occurs when a person dies. Social workers should be familiar with the concept for all aspects of practice. Palliative care is a model of health care for people with terminal illnesses, along with their families, in order to relieve suffering and improve quality of life. Palliative care is delivered by an interprofessional team which is most often comprised of medicine, nursing, social work and chaplaincy; other professions are often involved such as pharmacy, occupational therapy and others. This course addresses the social work role in grief and palliative care. (Note: This is an online course).",
