Students learn about the application of data collection skills to all phases of developing a health or human services program or service innovation, from needs assessment to analysis of findings to implementation of changes based on results.  Students learn to appreciate how these skills can be used as practical tools for identifying health and human services problems, for developing and implementing programs including taking a reflective practice approach, ensuring equity and fairness in program delivery (i.e., combating disparities), and generally promoting health and human services through effective and efficient programming.
