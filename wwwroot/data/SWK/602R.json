    "description": "This course examines practice models and multi-level methods of intervention for effective social work practice in health care, including health promotion, disease prevention, assessment treatment, rehabilitation, continuing care, and discharge planning within the context of social, economic, environmental, and cultural variations. The distribution and determinants, as well as psychological and behavioural aspects of health and disease across the life span are addressed. Practice models incorporate competence and empowerment as central themes. Different practice models of care are explored within the context of socio-cultural factors that inform health and well-being. Differences between the concepts of illness and disease are explored within the healthcare narrative. Resource allocation in the management of chronic and complex health conditions is examined, and interventions that support individual and family capacity to adapt to health crises or chronic health conditions are considered.\n(Note: This is an online course).",
