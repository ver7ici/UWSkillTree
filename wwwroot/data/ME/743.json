    "description": "Computer-aided engineering complements CAD/CAM by helping the engineer design not only individual components, but also design and analyse total systems. This course deals with the area of advanced vibration analysis and modelling using a combination of data acquisition and software analysis methods. This modal analysis approach to design uses several software packages. Topics discussed are the theory of modal analysis, parameter estimation and error assessment, computer modelling of structures, practical aspects of good data collection and manipulation. The course involves significant laboratory usage.",
