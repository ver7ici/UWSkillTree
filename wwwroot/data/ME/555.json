    "description": "Need for geometric modelling, historic developments; wire frame models; hidden line removed models; polyhedral models; surface models and solid models. Constructive solid geometry; boundary representation and decomposition modelling. Hybrid models. Data structures and their role in modelling. Curves and surfaces in modelling (Bezier, B-splines and NURBS). Geometric models and the role of engineers. Parametric and feature-based design. The course has a heavy lab component which provides exposure to solid modelling on SDRC IDEAS and PC-based CAD packages. [Offered: W]",
