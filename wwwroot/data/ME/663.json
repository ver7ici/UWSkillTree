    "description": "This course presents the concepts and details required to develop computer codes for the simulation of complex multidimensional fluid flows. The following topics will be covered: the finite volume discretization method, discretization schemes for diffusive fluxes, iterative solution algorithms, multigrid acceleration techniques, first and second order bounded discretization schemes for advective fluxes, special treatments for the coupled momentum and mass conservation equations, pressure redistribution techniques, velocity-pressure solution techniques, and extensions to multi-dimensions. Enrichment topics will be chosen from the following research areas: grid generation, turbulence modelling, and emerging discretization and solution algorithm technologies.",
