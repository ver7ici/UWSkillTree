    "description": "This course presents the principles relevant to understanding and modelling of vibrating systems. The systems may either be continuous, or discrete with multiple degrees of freedom. The following topics of a general nature are first covered: principles of dynamics, strain energy, virtual work, the variational principle, and Lagrange's equation. Discrete-system topics covered are eigenvalue problems, modal analysis, natural modes of vibration, solution of the characteristic determinant, and approximate methods of solution, (e.g., using finite element methods). Continuous-system topics covered are formulation of the boundary value problem, vibration of rods and membranes, Rayleigh's integral method, the Rayleigh-Ritz method, and Galerkin's method. The course work includes computer algebra, computer simulation, and experiments in the laboratory.",
