    "description": "A course presenting the fundamental ideas involved in conventional finite element analysis in mechanical engineering. Domain discretization, interpolation and shape functions, element derivation and types, element stiffness or property equations, assembly procedure, boundary conditions, solution methods for the algebraic equation system, applications in heat transfer, fluid flow, and stress analysis. Students will, throughout the course, write and test their own finite element code through individual subroutine construction as the course progresses. [Offered: F, S]",
