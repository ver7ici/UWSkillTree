    "description": "Mechanics of advanced fiber-reinforced composite materials, including continuous fiber, discontinuous fiber, and laminates.  Review of reinforcing fiber and matrix properties, and mechanics of anisotropic material.  Micromechanics concepts will be covered for material property and strength evaluation of lamina.  Governing equations for classical lamination theory will be derived and applied, and extended for analysis of laminated plates.  Includes advanced topics such as progressive failure, damage mechanics, fracture and energy absorbing characteristics, as well as fatigue of laminated structures.",
