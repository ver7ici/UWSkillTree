    "description": "This course explores the intersection between mathematics and computer science by examining general methods for solving problems efficiently. We will study a variety of algorithm design techniques for problems in diverse application areas and use mathematical models to compare algorithms.  Students will be introduced to \"big ideas\" from computer science, such as the generalization and reuse of previous solutions, and the notion of limits to the power of computation.",
