    "description": "The goal of the course is to ensure that all students will have a completed thesis proposal by the end of term.  Each student will make an oral presentation of their proposal to their committee members and other members of SEED.  The course will include discussions about how best to frame good research questions, find sources, organize a thesis, conduct ethical research, and communicate results.  Students will make regular class presentations throughout the term as their research proposal develops and thus gain skills in written, graphical oral presentation.",
