    "description": "This course provides students with an opportunity for an in-depth exploration of a topic of specific interest to the student, and to develop/enhance skills related to this area. For example, students could work as a member of a research team (on or off campus), or complete a placement at a health care, community-based, or other type of organization. Students must identify a supervisor, design an apprenticeship experience, establish individualized learning goals, and develop a plan for evaluation. As this course will be graded, there must be at least one academic deliverable (e.g., a review of the literature, proposal, presentation, knowledge dissemination product, etc.). The apprenticeship is unpaid and students will normally spend 6-8 hours per week for at least 12 weeks during the term.",
