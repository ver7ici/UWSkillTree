This course will address the role of geriatric medicine in the context of an aging population and provide in-depth coverage of frailty and geriatric syndromes. Students will practice critical appraisal skills of geriatric literature, and apply these to understanding how system design, interprofessional care, and geriatric medicine can improve outcomes for older persons. Students will also have the opportunity to learn about health system issues directly from stakeholders.",
