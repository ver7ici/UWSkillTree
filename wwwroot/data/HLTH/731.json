    "description": "This course will provide students with knowledge about social, organisational, legal and political dimensions of occupational health and safety so that they can design and implement research in work and health.  We will begin by reviewing the basic building blocks of our work and health systems: injury prevention and illness/injury rehabilitation systems. Using a variety of disciplinary perspectives, the course will then turn to key contemporary topics in work and health including COVID-19, the changing nature of work including the gig economy, financial incentive systems to maintain safe work spaces, return-to-work programs, and worker representation in work and health.The course will include presentations by researchers and practitioners from the work and health domain who will facilitate discussions on the challenges and opportunities of conducting and applying research in these areas.",
