    "description": "Food and nutrition are everywhere. We eat and drink every day, with a multitude of factors influencing the food that ends up on our plates, which then impacts our health and the health of the planet. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of public health nutrition, with an emphasis on the potential to promote the health of populations and the planet through changes to our food system and eating patterns. Topics include healthy and sustainable eating patterns and how current eating patterns compare, food insecurity, nutritional pseudoscience, and individual and ecologic approaches to promote healthy and sustainable eating.",
