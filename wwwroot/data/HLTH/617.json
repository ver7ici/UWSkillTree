Students will determine when interventions are justified; differentiate between individual and population level interventions; describe various types of interventions; use theory and evidence to select and design interventions including the appropriate mixes of intervention types, sites, and delivery systems. Emphasis is placed on developing a final project that integrates methods, concepts and theories in public health through reading and problem-based learning.",
