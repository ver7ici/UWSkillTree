A contract stipulating practicum objectives, and work to be completed and evaluated to meet these objectives, must be jointly approved by the student, the student's field supervisor, the student's academic advisor (if applicable), and the course instructor. A written report by the student, together with a letter from the field supervisor, are used by the course instructor to evaluate student performance. This course is intended for Masters level students.",
