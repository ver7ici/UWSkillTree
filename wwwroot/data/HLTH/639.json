    "description": "This intensive short course (0.5 credits) will provide graduate students with hands-on experience in designing evaluation processes for programs, services, responses and/or interventions. Students will be exposed to contemporary trends and issues in evaluation theory, as well as methods and practice, while working with stakeholders. Course content covers evaluation planning, design and implementation. Attention will be given to theories of change, stakeholder engagement, evaluation approaches and methodologies. Discussions extend beyond basic evaluation to include interpretation and dissemination of findings, as well as evaluation management. The course uses real world problems across a range of applied health interests, and emphasizes experiential learning through a case- and team-based approach. This course is typically delivered in a one-week block held on the UW main campus, with additional online components.",
