    "description": "This course introduces machine learning (ML) algorithms that are commonly used in artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and public health settings. Students will have hands-on experiences in making linkages across multiple datasets, developing ML algorithms to find patterns, and generating evidence and predictive models that help inform decision-making for policymakers and public health organizations. Challenges related to AI in health data will also be discussed, including data quality, explainability of artificial intelligence, unethical use of AI, and vulnerabilities in datasets that pose a threat to privacy and appropriate use of AI in the public health domain.",
