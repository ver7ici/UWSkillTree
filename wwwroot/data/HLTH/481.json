    "description": "Service learning is a method of teaching and reflection designed to use community service as a vehicle to enrich and integrate classroom learning, teach civic responsibility, encourage lifelong civic engagement, and strengthen communities. Students will be required to identify and design community learning placements, including the establishment of specific learning and outcome objectives, and a method of evaluation. Provisions must be approved by the community agency and the course coordinator. Placements are normally 8 to 10 hours per week for 8 weeks. In the final week of the term students will meet to reflect upon and share their experience with fellow students. Students will also complete a written report detailing whether and how they achieved their objectives, what they learned from the process relevant to the practice of health promotion, and how their experience utilized or exemplified course based material and assignments. Reports will be reviewed and graded as pass/fail by both the community partner and a faculty service leader.",
