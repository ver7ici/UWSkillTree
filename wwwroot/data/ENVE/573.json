    "description": "Importance and complications associated with environmental modelling, the model building process, limitations, and measures of success. Types of contaminants; transport phenomena with a focus on advection-dispersive transport; development of governing equations; types and utility of boundary and initial conditions; and mass balance considerations. Review of completely mixed systems including lakes, streams, source functions, feedback systems, and toxic substance models. Model calibration, sensitivity, and uncertainty; methods and approaches. Solute transport models and solution techniques including random walk, method of characteristics, finite difference method and finite volume method. Aspects of multiphase flow (gas/water and NAPL/water systems) with an emphasis on groundwater problems. Introduction to mass removal technologies for remediation of soil and groundwater systems.
