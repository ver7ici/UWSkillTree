It will introduce students to the many ways in which historians have studied the First and Second World Wars, as well as other conflicts.  Our seminar presentations and research papers will sample the 'old military history' of tactics and strategy, and we will also examine the 'new military history'  that focuses on the social, economic and cultural impact of war.",
