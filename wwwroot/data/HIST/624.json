It demonstrates how historians frame the historical interaction of mutable human culture and natural environment. The locus of study is western Europe, the period between the end of antiquity and the start of the industrial revolution. Each week, students will read assigned texts and discuss them in a seminar format. Ultimately, each student must write a final research essay.",
