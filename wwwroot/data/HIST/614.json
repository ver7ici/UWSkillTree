You will read works that interrogate and historicize the traditional foci of social historians - class gender and race.  You will read works informed by cultural theory, especially concerning the occupation of social space and the expression of experience of particularized social identities.  Each week, we will meet together in seminar to discuss the substance, theoretical orientation, methodology, and historiographical significance of the assigned material.  As such, active reading and constructive participation in seminar are key.  In addition, you will be required to lead seminar discussions and write an historiographical paper.",
