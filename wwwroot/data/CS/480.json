    "description": "Introduction to modeling and algorithmic techniques for machines to learn concepts from data. Generalization: underfitting, overfitting, cross-validation. Tasks: classification, regression, clustering. Optimization-based learning: loss minimization. regularization. Statistical learning: maximum likelihood, Bayesian learning. Algorithms: nearest neighbour, (generalized) linear regression, mixtures of Gaussians, Gaussian processes, kernel methods, support vector machines, deep learning, sequence learning, ensemble techniques. Large scale learning: distributed learning and stream learning. Applications: Natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, human computer interaction, information retrieval. [Note: Lab is not scheduled and students are expected to find time in open hours to complete their work. Offered: F,W,S]",
