    "description": "The purpose of the course is to present the familiar concepts of calculus at a rigorous level and to provide students who took the MATH 137/MATH 138/MATH 237 sequence with the background needed to be successful in PMATH 351 and PMATH 352. Topics discussed include the completeness properties of the reals; the density of the rationals; the topology of real n-dimensional space: open and closed sets, connectedness, compactness (by open covers), the Heine-Borel theorem, completeness; sequences in real n-dimensional space: convergence, Cauchy sequences, subsequences, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem; multivariable functions: limits, point-wise and uniform continuity, the extreme value theorem, uniform convergence of sequences of functions, Taylor's theorem, term-by-term differentiation of power series; integration in real n-dimensional space: Riemann integrability, Fubini's theorem for continuous functions on rectangles, term-by-term integration of power series.",
