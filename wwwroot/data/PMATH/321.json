    "title": "Non-Euclidean Geometry",
    "description": "An introduction to three types of non-Euclidean geometry: spherical, projective and hyperbolic geometry. Lines, distances, circles, triangles, and areas in these non-Euclidean spaces. Conic sections in the projective plane. Inversions and orthogonal circles. Models of the hyperbolic plane (such as the Poincar\u00e9 disc model or the upper-half plane model). Tilings of the hyperbolic plane. [Note: This course will be of interest to all math students.]",
