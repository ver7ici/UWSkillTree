    "description": "This is a seminar in the ontology of security.  Security is a contested concept, and in this course we ask what it is and how best to pursue it.  What do we mean by security?  What are we trying to protect?  From what? Why? How do we do it?  We begin by considering the concept of security in the abstract, and we then proceed to explore various specific conceptions. Along the way we encounter both traditional and non-traditional approaches to security.",
