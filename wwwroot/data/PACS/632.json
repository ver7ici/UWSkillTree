    "description": "Rebuilding states in the aftermath of conflict and state failure represents one of the foremost challenges facing the international community.  The post-Cold War era has shown that weak states represent as great a threat to international security and stability as strong ones.  The transition from war to peace and state failure to stability in these states can be conceptualized as encompassing three separate but interrelated transitions, in the economic, political and security spheres.  The course will deconstruct and analyze this triple transition, examine both its theoretical roots and practical application with reference to a number of recent case studies.",
