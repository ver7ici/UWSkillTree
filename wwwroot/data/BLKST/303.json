    "description": "Using Canada and the United States as its context, this course will explore the historical outcomes and future opportunities for North America's growing diversity at work, in the classroom, and in society. Students will learn to conduct assessments of their own and others' attitudes about cultural competency and racial differences and to develop materials that can be used to promote cross-racial understandings. Special attention may be given to issues of miscommunication across racial, social, cultural, ethnic, economic, and historic barriers within workplaces and school environments. Students will also explore various approaches used to mitigate ethno-racial differences including intercultural fluency, diversity, anti-oppression, and anti-racism training.",
