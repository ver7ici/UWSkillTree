    "description": "This course is intended to provide students with a practical overview of the hydrologic cycle and all of the interesting ways water flows and interacts with its environment, both surface and subsurface. The material is both qualitative and quantitative in nature and focuses on the circulation of water through the atmosphere, soil, groundwater aquifers, as well as looking at both the global fresh and marine water systems. Emphasis is placed on the physical aspects of hydrology, and the geologic and environmental factors that control the occurrence and cycling of water on Earth, as well as the impacts caused by population growth, contamination, urbanization or land use management, and climate change.
