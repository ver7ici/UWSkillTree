    "description": "This course will provide students with the foundational knowledge to become earth science literate, understanding Earth's influence on humans and human influence on the Earth. Students will learn to think like a geoscientist by adopting four ways of thinking that take into account a systems approach, a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and field thinking. Systematically learning about rocks, geological time, natural resources, natural hazards, and water in this course will prepare students to address many challenges currently facing society and to identify future potential opportunities.
