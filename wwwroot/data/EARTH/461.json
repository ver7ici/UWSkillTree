    "description": "Near-surface geophysics is used to characterize the shallow subsurface for a wide-spectrum of applications. This application-oriented course covers current methodology in near-surface geophysics, including electrical, electromagnetic, ground penetrating radar, seismic refraction, and well-logging methods. Techniques for geophysical data acquisition and interpretation are studied and applied to field data. Examples of the application of geophysical techniques to archeological, forensics, geotechnical, glaciology, and hydrogeological problems are examined. [Offered: F]",
