    "description": "A course intended to provide MSc and PhD students with a working knowledge of analytical techniques for solution of differential equations governing flow and mass transfer in hydrogeologic systems. Use of various transform methods such as Fourier and Laplace will be covered and applied to a variety of problems of hydrogeological interest. The course will consist of lectures, selected problem assignments and/or individual projects. Recommended: Second Year Calculus.",
