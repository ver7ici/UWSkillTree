    "description": "The morphology, taxonomy, biostratigraphy and paleoecology of marine and non-marine palynomorphs from Paleozoic to Recent time are examined. Palynomorph morphology and taxonomic principles and methods of pollen analysis, pollen dispersal, deposition and preservation are explored and related to the geological record and their use in environmental reconstructions. The role of pollen analysis in Quaternary paleoecology is presented.",
