    "description": "An introduction to the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics and the application of these laws to ideal systems, mixtures, and chemical reactions. Thermodynamic principles are used to study changes in state, including phase changes, and to establish the link between the equilibrium constant and the properties of the substances involved in a chemical reaction.
