    "description": "Overview of polymer production technology and polymer reaction engineering analysis tools. Examples from chain growth polymerization processes (free radical, ionic, living/controlled radical variants, metal co-ordination catalysis, etc.), different modes of polymer reactor operation (batch, semi-batch, continuous flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), tubular, trains of CSTRs), homogeneous (bulk/solution/suspension) and heterogeneous (emulsion/dispersion/co-ordinated/etc.), linear and branched/cross-linked chains. Calculations and mathematical models for rate, copolymer composition, molecular weight and sequence length characteristics, for polymer reactor design/optimization of polymer productivity and quality variables.
