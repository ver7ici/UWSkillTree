    "description": "This course gives a broad treatment of the subject of engineering decision, risk, and reliability.  Emphasis is on (1) the modelling of engineering problems and evaluation of system performance under conditions of uncertainty; (2) systematic development of design criteria, explicitly taking into account the significance of uncertainty; and (3) logical framework for risk assessment and risk-benefit tradeoffs in decision making.  The necessary mathematical concepts are developed in the context of engineering problems.",
