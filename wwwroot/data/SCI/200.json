In light of the Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) Model, energy supply demand, and conservation constraints, the use of non-renewable fossil and nuclear fuels, biofuels and other renewable fuels (wind, hydraulic, solar) will be reviewed and technical and social issues arising from their use explored. This course should prepare students to analyze and deal with the many contradictory energy usage claims and decide for themselves the best course of energy use. [Offered: F]",
