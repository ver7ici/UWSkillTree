    "description": "Some public service positions require proficiency in both of Canada's official languages, English and French.  This optional course is taught at an intermediate level, and is designed to refresh and reinforce linguistic skills students have acquired through previous French language training (e.g. senior high school or university courses).  It aims to strengthen proficiency in oral expression and comprehension, through the study of specialized vocabulary and situational learning scenarios, such as role-play exercises.  This course is restricted to students enrolled in the Master of Public Service program.",
