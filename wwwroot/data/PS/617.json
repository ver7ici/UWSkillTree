Using the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service as a guidebook, this course will first provide a broad overview of issues related to values and ethics, followed by a more specific examination of how values and ethics inform government policy planning, decision making, and service delivery.  Case studies drawn from government will be examined and discussed, and issues such as workplace diversity, confidentiality, and conflict of interest will be addressed.  This course is restricted to students enrolled in the Master of Public Service program.",
