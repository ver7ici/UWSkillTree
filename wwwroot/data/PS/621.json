    "description": "Project management - the coordination of people, processes, and information to achieve desired goals - is a core competency required of public servants.  This course provides students with training in the key elements of effective project management, including team building, priority setting, scheduling, resource management, communication, and project implementation and completion.  Examples of projects taken from government are used both as case studies for analysis and for hands-on project management exercises aimed at honing skills.  Because information management is a fundamental part of most government projects, the course explores tools, methodologies, and guidelines surrounding the access, evaluation, and use of government information. This course is restricted to students enrolled in the Master of Public Service program.",
