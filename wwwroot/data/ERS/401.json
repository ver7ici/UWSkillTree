    "description": "Translational ecology analyses ecosystems in a manner that leads to better policies, decision-making, and action. It is where environmental sciences meet environmental policy and governance. Translational ecology further embraces how the arts, media, and culture can act upon what emerges from analysis of socioecological systems. ERS 401 will focus student efforts on action-based and innovative modules and projects that provide a path to students designing their short- and long-term careers.",
