    "description": "Water governance refers to the processes and institutions through which societies make decisions and take actions that affect water. A profound, world-wide shift in the nature of water governance is occurring because governments can no longer be the primary source of decision-making authority regarding water. Instead, through mechanisms that range from markets to co-management arrangements, citizens, non-government organizations, and corporations are now playing key roles in water governance. The course explores major water governance challenges in Canada, and assesses different ways of addressing or resolving them.",
