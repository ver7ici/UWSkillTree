    "description": "Agriculture has destabilized the Earth's ecosystems at the planetary scale. Socio-cultural, economic, and political dimensions also shape the sustainability and resilience of our global and local food systems. This seminar course takes a regional focus to ground our discussions of pertinent concepts, challenges, and opportunities. We will explore regional issues and initiatives linked to food security, food sovereignty, resilient agriculture and agro-ecology, the energy-water-food nexus, food policy, food supply chains, urban food systems, alternative food initiatives, sustainable diets, and food waste reduction all within the context of the case study region.",
