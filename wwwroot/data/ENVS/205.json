    "description": "This course introduces students to the goals, principles, and practices of sustainability. Sustainability thinking, policies, and programs aim to increase and maintain human well-being by integrating or reconciling current social and economic goals (e.g., economic growth; poverty alleviation; gender inequality) with long-term environmental objectives (e.g., improved environmental quality; climate stability; biodiversity conservation; and managing resources to ensure future access). Case studies are used to illustrate solutions for realizing sustainability, emphasizing efforts underway for reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The course assesses four intersecting and sometimes competing approaches for realizing sustainability: technological innovation; market-based approaches; state regulation and investment; and individual and collective ('grassroots') action. Key values underlying sustainability are explored, including notions of the \"good life\", democracy, social justice, and efficiency.",
