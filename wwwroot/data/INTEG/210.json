    "description": "Collaboration and teamwork are essential for solving complex, real-world problems and are therefore in high demand by employers. Yet students rarely have the opportunity to study and apply the theory and best practices for making collaboration work. In this course, you will learn how to leverage this research to acquire a variety of important skills. These include: effective communication in groups, proactively managing group conflict, identifying biases that hinder creativity, and leveraging diversity to improve outcomes. You will also put those skills into practice throughout the course and reflect on how you can apply them in other situations.",
