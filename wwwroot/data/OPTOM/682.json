    "description": "This course will examine the behavior and neural substrates of eye movements, specifically covering fixation, saccades, vestibular ocular interactions, smooth pursuit and the near triad synkinesis (vergence, accommodation and pupil responses).  Oculomotor behaviors for each system will be defined with respect to their specific stimuli, their dynamic and steady state responses.  Adaptive process within and across systems will be examined.  Control theory will be introduced as a means to model each system.  The course will allow emphasis to be focused on oculomotor systems pertinent to the student's research.",
