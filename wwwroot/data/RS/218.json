    "description": "Students will be introduced to the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) by way of selected readings which deal with a particular aspect of the human predicament. The focus will be on exploring relationships via narrative passages in the Old Testament and particularly in the Book of Genesis. The following relationships will be discussed: spousal; human/God; parent/child; siblings; gender issues in narratives of rape, incest, seduction, and dominance. The focus of this course will be more on select specific themes rather than an overview of many themes.",
