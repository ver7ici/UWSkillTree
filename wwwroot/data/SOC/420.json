    "title": "Seminar in Social Inequality",
    "description": "This course provides students with the tools and vocabulary to understand inequality - how it is produced, how it is experienced and how it is contested in Canada and globally. Students will acquire knowledge about the historic foundations of contemporary inequalities, such as settler colonialism, and will examine proposed technological, political, and institutional solutions that sometimes mitigate inequalities of race, gender, and social class, and sometimes wind up reproducing them instead. Students will deepen their knowledge and expertise of these topics via discussion, research, writing, and class presentations.",
