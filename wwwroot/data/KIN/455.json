    "description": "This course focuses on the neurobiological basis underlying brain and behaviour development from conception to adolescence. The emergence of neural functions and corresponding behaviours will be discussed in the context of a complex interaction between genes and environment. Topics include molecular/genetic perspectives, epigenetics, critical periods of cortical development, plasticity, sensorimotor and cognitive development. The course focuses on typical development, but conditions that induce abnormal brain development will be considered.",
