    "description": "The purpose of this course is to introduce students to basic aspects of functionally-oriented anatomy of the human central nervous including the brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves and the tissues they innervate using pre-dissected cadavers. After completing this course, students should expect to have mastered the location of major neuroanatomic landmarks, be able to identify these landmarks on both postmortem brains and neuroimages (i.e., CT scan, MRI scan), understand the cellular components of the nervous system, and should be able to propose neuroanatomical explanations for normal and abnormal sensory experiences and motor, cognitive and emotional behaviours.",
