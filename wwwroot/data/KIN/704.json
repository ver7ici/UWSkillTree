    "description": "Lipids are intimately linked to all cellular functions based not only on their structural role as membrane components, but also their use as fuel, interactions with proteins, as important second messengers in cell signalling and potent regulators of gene expression.  The present course will examine the properties and how they impact various biological functions and human conditions including inflammation and cardiovascular disease.  The course will also examine dominant lip analytical techniques that are specific to this field of study and examine the emerging field of lipidomics.",
