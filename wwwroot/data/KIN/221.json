    "description": "The course is structured to introduce measurement, analytical, and computation techniques involving multi-segmental, dynamic analysis of human activity. Examples of human activity in occupational, clinical, and leisure settings from the perspectives of anthropometry, kinematics, kinetics, energetics, muscle mechanics, and electromyography are given. The utility of biomechanical variables in the solution of questions involving human movement.",
