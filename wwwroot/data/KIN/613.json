    "title": "Modern Methods in Biomechanical Modeling, Kinematics, and Kinetics",
    "description": "Biomechanics research typically requires the integration of experimental data collection and theoretical modeling approaches to answer complex questions.  The purpose of Kin 613 is to sensitize incoming graduate students to the range, biological basis, and practicality of using or developing mathematical models for biomechanical investigations.  This contrasts with KIN 612, which focuses on promoting rigorous experimental data collection and biological signal interpretation, or Kin 611, which seeks to develop the historical foundations of biomechanical research and promote critical reading of the scientific literature.",
