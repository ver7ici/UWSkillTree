    "description": "This course invites students to work with a professor on the latter's research project. During this unpaid apprenticeship (six to eight hours per week throughout the term), students will do agreed-upon tasks to help them acquire skills and gain understanding of the research process and of the discipline itself. The faculty member and the student will determine the exact duties together.  A document outlining these duties must be approved by the Social Development Studies chair and kept on file. The course is graded on a CR/NCR basis.  Paid or volunteer positions outside this course are not eligible for credit. [Note: Formerly ISS 495R]",
