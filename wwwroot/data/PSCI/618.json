    "description": "Non-state actors (NHOs, corporations, networks, etc.) play increasingly important roles in global governance,  This course examines different theoretical arguments about their roles.  Overarching questions include the extent to which they support or undermine states' purposes in global governance, what and how much they can contribute to global problem solving, and possible limits or critiques of their participation.  It will draw on studies of non-state actors in many issue areas, venues, and parts of the world in an effort to understand what these have in common with each other, as well as possible lines of differentiation among them.",
