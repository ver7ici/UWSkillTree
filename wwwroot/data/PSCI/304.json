    "description": "This course examines Africa's role in international order and offers an in-depth study of the evolution of Africa's global political relations. Engaging with concepts related to political and economic underdevelopment, post coloniality, and early Pan-African political thought and practice, students will be challenged to develop and apply an historical understanding of Africa's past political relations to analyses of contemporary African multilateralism, global Pan-Africanism, and increased political and economic engagement with world nations. Students will engage with current concepts of Pan-African politics and envision prospects of future Black global leadership.",
