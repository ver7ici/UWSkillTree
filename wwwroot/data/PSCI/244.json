    "description": "Why do some powerful dictators allow independent legislatures and parties to exist? Why are the frontlines of some civil wars spared from violence? Why do the same people sometimes choose language to define their ethnic identity but then choose religion at other times? Students will examine apparently random, puzzling, and even seemingly irrational choices made in political life. This course uses a rational choice framework to provide a unified explanation for some of these puzzling questions.",
