    "description": "This course stretches the definition of who are the actors that conduct the practice of diplomacy, where the sites of diplomacy are located, and what aims are privileged.  Conventional diplomacy showcases state-centric activity with an emphasis on hierarchy, protocol, and closed negotiations.  Unconventional diplomacy in contrast is open-ended with a focus on transparency, inclusiveness and the pursuit of global governance.  The course begins with an overview of the pressures for change in diplomacy, and then moves to a detailed examination of specific areas where unconventional diplomacy has become prominent including think tank diplomacy, humanitarian diplomacy, 'pandemic' diplomacy, and celebrity diplomacy.",
