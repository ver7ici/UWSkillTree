    "description": "Large developing countries like Brazil, Russia, India, and China stand at the centre of much of current international political economy.  Their national development efforts profoundly shape their international participation and vice versa.  This course will cover theoretical and conceptual debates about the roles of these \"middle range\" or \"emerging\" powers, then examine their national economies, before turning to see how they individually and collectively (with the other emerging powers) fit into current global governance.",
