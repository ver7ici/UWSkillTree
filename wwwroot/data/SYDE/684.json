    "description": "The course covers fundamental topics of biocompatibility of materials in medicine (polymers, ceramics, metals, composites, bioengineered materials).  Fundamental principles of materials science (bonding, atomic/molecular structure) as well as interfacial engineering of materials will be reviewed.  Materials response to biological systems such as corrosion, degradation, leaching and fracture will be studied in the context of specific biomedical applications.  The host response to materials (immune, inflammatory response and coagulation) will also be treated.  Specific examples of material interactions with biological systems such as bone, blood, skin and the eye will be studied.",
