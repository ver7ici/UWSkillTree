    "description": "In this course, students will become familiar with the physiology and anatomical structures of the human body. The structure, functions, and properties of major physiological systems (e.g., musculoskeletal, nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory) will be presented in relation to modelling physiological systems and the design of biomedical devices (imaging, assistive, and diagnostic). Various aspects of pathology and how they influence measurements will also be introduced. [Offered: F]",
