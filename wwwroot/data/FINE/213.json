    "description": "Some of the finest works of art in the western world were produced and some of the most successful artists flourished in this tumultuous century that saw the split in the western Christian Church and the continued rise of extraordinarily powerful court families and monarchs. This course will examine these works of art and the artists against this backdrop. Arranged according to patrons, the course also examines particular stylistic trends (Mannerism, the persistence of the Gothic, etc.) as well as other pertinent issues such as collecting, the writing of art history, the teaching of art, and the role of the artist in society. [Note: Art History course]",
