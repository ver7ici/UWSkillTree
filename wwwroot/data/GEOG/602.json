    "title": "Remote Sensing of Cold Regions",
    "description": "This course focuses on the extraction of hydrologically-relevant parameters from remote sensing that are germane to cold regions such as snowfall, snow cover, glaciers & ice caps, lake and river ice, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground.  The determination of hydrological parameters in the liquid and vapour phases such precipitiation, soild moisture, surface water, and evaporation/evapotranspiration from remote sensing, as well as the integration of remote sensing data into hydrological models are also covered.  Prerequisites: UW undergraduates: GEOG 271, 371, 471 or undergraduate Geomatics degree.  Undergraduate Geography degree with suitable remote sensing experience. Students with no remote sensing experience but strong GIS experience are required to take a 675 Directed Reading course entitled \"Remote Sensing Analysis\" prior to enrolment in 602. *eligible for MES.",
