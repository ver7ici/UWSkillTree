    "description": "An in-depth study of current machine learning algorithms and their applications in geospatial science, with a focus on earth observation data processing and analysis. Topics include k-nearest neighbour, decision trees, support vector machines, ensemble learning, and some deep neural networks (e.g., CNN, U-Net). Machine learning algorithms implemented using Python will be applied for semantic segmentation, land use and land cover classification, and building and road detection using aerial and satellite images.",
