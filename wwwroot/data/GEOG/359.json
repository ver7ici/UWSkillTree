    "description": "The world is undergoing a fundamental transition to a low-carbon economy as countries strive to reach the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets agreed to in the Paris Climate Agreement. This course examines how this rapid transformation influences all sectors in society and provides students with essential knowledge to assess associated risks and opportunities for communities, government, and business. Policy, economic and social dimensions of low carbon societal transitions are critically examined and debated using Canadian and international case studies. Evolving carbon regulatory frameworks and markets are reviewed, and students engage with techniques related to carbon accounting and carbon risk assessment.",
