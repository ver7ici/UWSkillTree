    "description": "The aim of this course is to develop student's knowledge of different approaches to social group work practice, and the ways in which specialized knowledge of client's life conditions, life circumstances, and significant life events informs social work practice with groups within a generalist framework. Emphasis is placed upon conceptualizing and analyzing group work skill and the capacity for self-directed practice with groups directed towards increasing the resiliency of the group as a whole and the resiliency of individual group members. A salient goal is the use of democratic means so that group process in all social work groups reflects a vision of social justice.",
