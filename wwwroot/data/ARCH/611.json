    "description": "In architecture, there is a crucial tension between the act of drawing -- the representation of three dimensioned forms in two dimensions -- and the fabrication of those forms in a concrete context. Using case studies of artisanal production and industrial design and manufacture, and addressing the possibilities and limitations of the computer as a design and production tool in architecture, this seminar draws out a discourse on the cultural momentum of composition and representation, and the fabrication of architectural forms in both virtual and material realities, establishing provisional guidelines for their interplay.  Consent of instructor required for those outside of the M.Arch program",
