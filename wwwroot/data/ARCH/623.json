    "description": "Landscape design is being reshaped by ecosystems thinking. This course introduces the concepts of ecosystems design for urban and peripheral landscapes. Beginning with case studies on the spatial forms taken by the historic co-evolution of nature and cultural forms in urban land systems, the course introduces ecosystems-based classifications combining abiotic, biotic, and cultural analyses; urban land mosaics based on urban landscape ecologies; and green infrastructures. It concludes with contemporary case studies demonstrating the scope of ecosystems-based urban design and planning, guidelines for ecosystems design, and evolutionary design approaches.",
