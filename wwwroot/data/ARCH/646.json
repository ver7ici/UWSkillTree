    "description": "This course explores the relationship between Architecture and the development of early, modern and science fiction films via the examination of the source and methods of portrayal of architectural expression in film.  Films will be viewed to examine precedents for imagery, set design, location selection, as well as the integrated vision of the urban and dystopic environmental future.  Futuristic film architecture will provide an opportunity to study a vision of the future of urban built form and provide a forum for critical discussion.  Assignments will require that the students become familiar with different methods of media:  video filming, sound and visual editing, web page production.",
