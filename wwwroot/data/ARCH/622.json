    "description": "This course will discuss issues/challenges faced by cities (from downtown revitalization to suburbanization).  Research has shown that their physical environments will fare better if such cities are designed, planned, and modeled in collaboration with professionals (i.e. architects and urban designers) and the community.  Students will investigate how design projects improve the quality of life of mid-size cities (i.e. creative city concept).  Together, we will focus on identifying opportunities for innovative collaborations and tangible improvements to the design of urban environments.  The school is especially interested in strengthening collaboration among universities, community residents, planning and design practitioners, and policymkaers to seize their own destiny to design, model, and plan.  Accordingly, we will investigate thematic (e.g. urban revitalization, design/aesthetics, environmental/greening, gentrification, housing, and multiculturalism) and policy-oriented areas (e.g. urban design guidelines, new urbanism, intensification, and land-use development patterns) that relate to the mid-size city.  This is a seminar-based course and student participation is key to it's success.",
