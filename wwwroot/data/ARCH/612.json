    "title": "Originality and Invention in Architecture",
    "description": "Professional knowledge in architecture involves not only the application of science or theory to instrumental problems, but also the innovation that calls for cognitive risk-taking, reflection-in-action, and learning-by-doing. This practice is legitimized by a discourse that evolved  in the nineteenth century, and that defines a good project as an original project. Critically engaging this discourse of originality, this course addresses the processes and strategies that foster invention in architecture in a reflective practicum that emphasizes the value of synthetic thinking across disciplines.  Consent of instructor required for those outside of the M.Arch program.",
