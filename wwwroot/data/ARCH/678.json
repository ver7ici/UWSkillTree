    "description": "The intention of the course is to learn to achieve design intent in terms of artificial and natural lighting by digital means. There are three componentsd to the course. One is lighting concepts in terms of colour and materiality, light propagation, sky conditions, sun movement and quantitative lighting analysis including glare. Another component is the use of physically accurate lighting simulation and rendering software. A third is lighting design and critical evaluation through exercises and a small design project.",
