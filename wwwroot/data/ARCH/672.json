    "description": "Vernacular building techniques once manifested the principles of passive solar heating, passive cooling and daylighting by solar orientation. Searching for ways to design energy efficient,  comfortable and functional buildings, this workshop revisits the principles of passive heating,  cooling and solar lighting, and explores the operation and use of energy simulation computer programs and post occupancy analysis within the context of sustainable design. The methods will  be tested in two design projects: a freestanding suburban house and an urban row house. Consent of instructor required for those outside of the M.Arch program.",
