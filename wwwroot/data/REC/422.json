    "description": "This course examines the employment of recreation, sport, and tourism to transform, enliven, and/or alter community spaces. In doing so, it explores the potential of (re)shaping, (re)territorializing, and (re)making the built environment with the intent of interpreting, narrating, and imagining places to inscribe them with meaning and value. With an emphasis on principles of transformative placemaking, students are encouraged to envision meaningful alterations of places to better meet the needs of communities.",
