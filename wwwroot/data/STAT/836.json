    "description": "The objective of this course is to develop understanding and working knowledge of spatial models and analysis of spatial data.  The course provides an introduction to the rudiments of statistaical inference based on spatially correlated data.  Methods of estimation and testing will be developed for geostatistical models based on variograms and spatial autoregressive models.  Concepts and application of methods will be emphasized through case studies and projects with health applications.",
