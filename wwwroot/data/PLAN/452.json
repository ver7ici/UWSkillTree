    "description": "This course considers Policy Analysis and Program Evaluation as step-by-step processes of prescriptive activities used to aid decision-making. For heuristic purposes, simplified models of the policy and program processes are presented so that basic analytical methods for each step in these processes can be explored. The course highlights quick, yet theoretically defensible, methods useful for smaller-scale analyses or for taking a preliminary approach to larger-scale analyses. The instructor will present case materials from planning and policy to illustrate the analytical methods.",
