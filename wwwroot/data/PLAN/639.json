    "description": "This course examines the relationship between the environment (built/physical, economic, social, political and natural aspects) and population health. It focuses on conceptual and empirical links among current environment-health issues such as air quality, active transportation, injury prevention, climate change, and mental well-being. Emphasis is placed on the role of urban planners in collaboration with allied professionals (e.g., public health, engineering, law enforcement, architecture) in creating and maintaining healthy built environments to improve population health with a focus on key health issues. The importance of multi-sectoral collaboration, healthy public policy and effective tools for assessing healthy communities will be illustrated using case studies.\n*eligible for MES.",
