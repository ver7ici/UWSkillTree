    "description": "This course introduces students to a variety of topics associated with aggregate resources (sand, gravel and stone), important but contentious issues in planning and resource management in Ontario and elsewhere.  Products produced by pits and quarries are critical to infrastructure and urban development, but are subject to a number of land use/environmental issues and potential conflicts.  Students will be exposed to a range of topics related to aggregate resources - relevant legislation, geology, economics, Site Plans, technical requirements for licensing, technical/peer reviews, resources management, cumulative effects, water resources, pit and quarry rehabilitation and after-use strategies, and significant Tribunal decisions.  Emphasis will be placed on practical applications and \"real world\" issues.",
