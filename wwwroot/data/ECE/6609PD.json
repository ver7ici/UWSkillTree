    "title": "High Voltage Engineering Applications",
    "description": "This course deals with generation and measurement aspects of high voltages and industrial applications of high voltage engineering.  The first part concentrates on generation of high voltage ac, dc and impluse voltages of both switching and lightning surges.  Measurements techniques based on different types of potential dividers and spark gaps for ac, dc, and impulse measurements will be covered.  The second part deals with generation and measurements of special types of high voltages needed for industrial applications.  The course also covers non-destructive measurements like surface and internal discharges, capacitance and loss factor and some optical techniques.  Recommended Background:  Basic knowledge of circuit analysis and low voltage measurement techniques is required.  Familiarity with electrical power system components is useful.",
