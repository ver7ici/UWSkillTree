    "description": "This biomedical engineering core course focuses on equipping students with the foundational knowledge in human biology through a problem-solving oriented treatment of biological phenomena at both physiological and cellular levels.  The major aim of this course is to develop students' literacy in biology and to show them how various biological phenomena can be analytically explained and justified with numbers.  It is also intended to illustrate how biology knowledge can be integrated with engineering principles to address real-world diagnostic needs.  Case descriptions would be included of medical devices that involved discipline-specific knowledge in electrical and computer engineering.",
