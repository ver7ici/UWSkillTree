    "description": "Adaptive control is an approach used to deal with the unavoidable problem of plant uncertainty. Rather than providing a fixed linear time-invariant controller, this approach yields a controller whoes parameters change with time. This controller typically consists of a linear time-invariant compensator together with a tuning mechanism which adjusts the controller gains; typical control objectives are stabilization and tracking.The bulk of the course will be centered on an identifier based approach. Here one chooses a model for the plant, whose parameters are unknown, and the plant parameters are recursively estimated; controller gains are computed assuming that the present estimate is corrent. We first study algorithms to carry out parameter estimation, we then look at various control laws, and finally these are combined to yield an adaptive controller.
