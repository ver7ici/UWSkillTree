    "description": "This course requires a two-page report where students reflect on the experience gained during the second co-op term. Students identify the requirements in their job where they were able to practice engineering, how theory learned in academic terms was applied to solve problems in the work place, and significant contributions they made during their work term. If students did not secure a co-op position, they are to reflect on how they used their time to update their skills. The report template is accessed online and is submitted online.
