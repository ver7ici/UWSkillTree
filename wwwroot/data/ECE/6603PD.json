    "description": "The course addresses all dimensions of Power Quality (PQ) issues including mitigation strategies.  The focus is mainly on qualitative concepts and comprehensive coverage.  The course introduces PQ definitions, limitations, related international standards and mathematical techniques for PQ analysis of power systems.  Different identification, localization and classification techniques for PQ problems will be investigated.  The various kinds of PQ problems and their effect on the load/system equipment will be looked at in detail.  The mitigation strategies such as passive filtering, active and hybrid power filtering, static VAR compensation, DVR, UPQC, etc. will be investigated.  Areas covered include voltage sags, interruptions, transients, flickers, harmonics and modeling and simulation of utility systems.  The grounding imperfection as a major cause for PQ problems will be addressed in detail.  Moreover, requirements and impact of distributed generation (DG) on network power quality will be studied in detail.  Effect of DG on voltage regulation, relaying, losses, islanding and standards will be examined.  Recommended Background:  Basic understanding of modeling of power system elements and analysis techniques is required.  Familiarity with a programming language and/or a simulation package such as EMTDC / PSCAD and MATLAB is desirable.",
