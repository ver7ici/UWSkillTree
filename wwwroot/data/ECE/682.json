    "description": "An introduction to control theory for linear time-invariant finite-dimensional systems from both the state-space and input-output viewpoints. State-space theory: the concepts of controllability, observability, stabilizability, and detectability; the pole-assignment theorem; observers and dynamic compensation; LQR regulators. Input-output theory: the ring of polynomials and the field of rational functions; the algebra of polynomial and rational matrices; coprime factorization of transfer matrices; Youla parametrization, introduction to optimal control.",
