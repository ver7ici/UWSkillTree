    "description": "This course consists of three parts: Part 1 will be concerned with the definitions of entropies as information measures and the derivation of the rate distortion function of Gaussian sources, which will form the basis for performance comparison. Part 2 will discuss the derivations, design and performance of certain compression techniques, including dpcm/entropy coding, predictive coding, linear predictive coding (LPC), adaptive predictive coding (APC), vector quantization, and tree and trellis coding. Part 3 will consider applications of compression techniques to speech and image processing.",
