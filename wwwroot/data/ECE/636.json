    "description": "Design of MOS and bipolar analog integrated circuits at the transistor level, with an emphasis on the design of single-stage and multi-stage op amps.  Related topics include biasing, compensation and noise will be covered.  In addition, higher level analog and mixed analog/digital subsystems will be discussed, time permitting.  Students enrolling in this course are expected to have a background equivalent to the material covered in ECE 242, formerly ECE 332.",
