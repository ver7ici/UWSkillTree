    "description": "The definitions and concepts associated with short circuit, power flow and stability analysis are presented and discussed.  Models, techniques and tools used for these types of studies are discussed with a practical perspective, and applied to the comprehensive analysis of a typical test system.  Controls and protections for voltage, angle and frequency control and regulation, such as Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR), Power System Stabilizers (PSS) , Automatic Generation Control (AGC), under-voltage and under-frequency relays, are also studied and applied.  [Note: Required background - ECE 467 or equivalent.}",
