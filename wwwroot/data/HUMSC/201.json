    "description": "What is the nature of, and relationship between, reason and faith? Does this fundamental distinction lead to other distinctions such as those between explanation and revelation, and the rational and the intuitive? What impact do such modes of thought have on notions such as providence, perception, and truth?  What comparisons and contrasts can be drawn between each mode and prevailing modern perspectives? This course investigates how a dialogue with core texts (e.g., Boethius, Aquinas, Dante, Bacon, Milton, Descartes, Hume, Austen) offers ways of understanding these issues.",
