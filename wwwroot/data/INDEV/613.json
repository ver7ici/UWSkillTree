    "description": "Whereas \"water is life\" is a frequently invoked truism, the fact that 1.1 billion people lack access to a safe supply of drinking water and 2.4 billion lack access to adequate sanitation suggests that the wrong kind of water may also bring both misery and death.  This course surveys the role of water in human security and development.  It locates water use in history and articulates the links between water and human security through a mix of cases and issues from around the world.",
