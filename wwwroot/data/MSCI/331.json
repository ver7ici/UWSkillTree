    "description": "This first course in optimization uses a quantitative approach to problem solving involving, mathematical modelling and formulations, solution methods, and output analysis. Students are introduced to a variety of practical problem formulations in management and engineering, a number of solution methods, including, but not limited to, linear optimization, network models, project management, and decision analysis. Students are also involved in a group project, where they go through conceptual and operational model design, analytical solution, output analysis, and recommendation. [Offered: F,W,S]",
