    "description": "A reflection exercise through which students document the linkages between their work-term experiences and progress towards achieving their academic, professional and personal goals.  The documentation can be presented in various forms, consistent with the Faculty's guidelines. The report is evaluated on the basis of both the quality of presentation and strength of reflection. Work-term reports are required courses for the degree but their grades are not included in the average. However, failed work-term report evaluations may delay a student's progress as indicated in the Examinations and Promotions section of this calendar. Details regarding the evaluation of the work-term reports can be obtained from the student's program advisor.",
