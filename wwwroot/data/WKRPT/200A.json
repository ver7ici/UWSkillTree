The report is evaluated on the basis of written communication skills and technical proficiency in the subject matter as demonstrated by the report. Work-term reports are required courses for the degree but their grades are not included in the average. However, failed work-term report evaluations may delay a student's progress as indicated in the Examinations and Promotions section of this calendar. Details regarding the evaluation of the work-term reports can be obtained from the student's program advisor. [Note: This course is offered on a CR/NCR basis.]",
