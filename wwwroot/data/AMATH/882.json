    "description": "Dynamic mathematical modelling of biological process at the cellular level.  Intracellular networks:  metabolism, signal transduction, and genetic regulatory networks.  Neural networks: from biophysical modelling of single neurons to the analysis of network behaviour.  Modelling will be carried out primarily through ordinary differential equations; analysis will involve application of dynamical systems tools and simulations.  Other relevant modelling frameworks (PDEs, delay equations, stochastic methods) will be touched on as time allows.",
