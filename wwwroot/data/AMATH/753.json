    "description": "The main themes are well-posedness of problems, Hilbert space methods, variational principles and integral equation methods. Topics include: first-order nonlinear partial differential equations, quasilinear hyperbolic systems, potential theory, eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, semi-groups, and power series solutions. Applications from various areas will be used to motivate and illustrate the theory. A previous course in partial differential equations at the undergraduate level is strongly recommended.",
