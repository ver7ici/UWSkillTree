    "description": "This course provides an introduction to basic principles in medical chemistry such as physiochemical properties, drug design and pharmacological actions.  A brief overview of the theory and application of computer aided drug design principles will provide a basic understanding of the \"in silico\" drug design concepts.  The student will develop an understanding toward the concepts of peptide/petidomimetic design as therapeutic agents.  A series of case studies on clinical drugs will be presented with major emphasis on their design, synthesis, reaction mechanisms and structure-activity relationship studies.  A section of the course will address the pathophysiology and pharmacology of diseases affecting the central nervous system.  In addition, learning activities and assignments include a term paper submission and in class presentation of current topics in medicinal chemistry.",
