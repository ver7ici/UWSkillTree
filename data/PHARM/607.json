    "description": "This course provides an introduction to modern spectroscopic methods with emphasis on pharmaceutical analysis.  First few lectures will cover the theory and application of UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy.  A review of NMR spectroscopy will focus on commonly used techniques such as 1H NMR and 13C NMR and their application.  The student will get a practical experience in spectroscopic methods for structural elucidation by using UVS-VIS, IR and NMR spectrometers. In addition, a section will address the theory and application of mass spectrometry. Examples of drug molecules/pharmaceuticals and their spectroscopic characteristics will be discussed.  In addition, learning activities and assignments include problem sets and structural elucidation of an unknown organic molecule.",
