    "description": "This course provides an opportunity for students to design experiments and carry out\nindependent research projects in the area of neurodegenerative disorders. Student projects are aimed to study\nthe pathophysiology of Alzheimer\u00bfs disease and related neurodegenerative disorders by various techniques such\nas designing novel small molecules and peptides by computational chemistry. Furthermore, the interactions\nbetween small molecules/peptides with misfolded proteins/peptides will be evaluated by biochemical and\nbiophysical techniques with emphasis on fluorescence spectroscopy and ligand-protein kinetic studies.\nMicroscopy techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis will be studied. Students will\nbe trained in using the computational chemistry software Discovery Studio Structure-Based-Design. Individual\nstudent projects may include compound characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR),\nhigh performance-liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)\ntechniques. Students are expected to spend between 10-11 weeks in the research lab working on their assigned\nprojects. Course re-requisite include completion and proof of safety training including WHMIS, workplace\nviolence training and safety orientation.",
