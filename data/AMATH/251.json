    "description": "AMATH 251 is an advanced-level version of AMATH 250. This course offers a more theoretical treatment of differential equations and solution methods. In addition, emphasis will be placed on computational analysis of differential equations and on applications in science and engineering. [Note: AMATH 251 may be substituted for AMATH 250 whenever the latter is a requirement in an Honours plan. Offered: F]",
