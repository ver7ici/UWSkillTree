    "description": "This course studies several classes of methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations in\nmultiple dimensions on structured and unstructured grids. Finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation\nlaws: linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems; stability; numerical conservation. Finite element methods for\nelliptic and parabolic equations: weak forms; existence of solutions; optimal convergence; higher-order\nmethods. Examples from fluid and solid mechanics. Additional topics as time permits.",
