    "description": "An introduction to contemporary mathematical concepts in signal analysis.  Fourier series and Fourier transforms (FFT), the classical sampling theorem and the time-frequency uncertainty principle.  Wavelets and multiresolution analysis.  Applications include oversampling, denoising of audio, data compression, and singularity detection. [Note: Offered in the fall of odd years.]",
