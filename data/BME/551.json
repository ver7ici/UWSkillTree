    "description": "This course introduces students to the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system, including motor control and rehabilitation engineering. Multibody models in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) will be used to study the dynamics of normal and pathological motions. Motor control will be included, as well as the identification of body segment parameters and the dynamics of muscles. Applications may include assistive devices, rehabilitation, human gait, occupational biomechanics, and other activities. [Offered: W]",
