    "description": "Basic concepts of hardware measurement systems pertaining to the measurement of biosignals: active and passive circuit elements, Kirchhoff's laws, mesh and nodal circuit analysis, principle of superposition, step responses of first and second order networks, sinusoidal steady state analysis, input-output relationships, transfer functions and frequency response of linear systems, operational amplifiers, analog signal detection, conditioning and conversion systems, transducers, difference and instrumentation amplifiers, A/D and D/A conversion. Examples will be presented in the form of physiological monitoring hardware for vital measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electromyography (EMG).
