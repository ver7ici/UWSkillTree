    "description": "The fundamental laws of electricity, magnetism, and optics will be taught through the introduction to basic concepts of medical imaging: radiation for imaging, x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound or sonography imaging, electric impedance tomography, confocal microscopy, fluoroscopy. Radionuclide imaging: Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission computed tomography (PET). Emerging technologies: elastography, tHz imaging, molecular imaging will also be discussed.  [Offered: F]",
