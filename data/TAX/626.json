The course also deals with related debt and equity financing and capital restructuring issues.  Focus is placed on the use of the numerous reorganization provisions contained in the Income Tax Act.  This is in order to facilitate the completion of transactions designed to meet the stakeholders' objectives in a tax efficient manner while taking into account an analysis of the business and tax risks associated with the structure.",
