    "description": "What is the nature of, and relationship between, the sacred and the profane? This course will examine diverse manifestations of the sacred and the profane by emphasizing the nature of their interaction and the impact on our understanding of contemporary human civilization. A dialogical method in exploring these ideas will be encouraged. Areas to be investigated include space, time, ritual, culture, morality, life, and death. The readings will be taken from core texts spanning a wide variety of fields and authors (e.g., Eliade, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Pieper, Charles Taylor, Mary Douglas).",
