    "description": "What is the relationship of health to life? This course will focus on identifying areas of strain or conflict in public health and everyday life in relation to tensions connected to models of health and sickness. It will examine contested representations of the relations of health and life, healing and cure, pleasure and pain, self-governance and negligence, body and mind, and policy and polity. Core texts will span a wide variety of fields, eras, and authors (e.g., Plato, Descartes, Freud, Parsons, Foucault, Gadamer, Garfinkel).",
