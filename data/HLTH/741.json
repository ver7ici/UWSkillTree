The supervised research practicum is intended to enhance basic or applied research skills as demonstrated through previous practica, research assistantships or other research experiences. The placement may involve a combination of research design or development, data collection (using quantitative or qualitative methods), analyses, interpretation and presentation. A contract stipulating practicum objectives, and work to be completed and evaluated to meet these objectives, must be jointly approved by the student, the student's field supervisor, the student's academic advisor (if applicable), and the course instructor. A written report by the student, together with a letter from the field supervisor, are used by the course instructor to evaluate student performance.",
