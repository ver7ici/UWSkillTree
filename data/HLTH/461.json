To this end, students will receive instruction upon, and gain direct experience in, a variety of areas; for example, animal ethics and husbandry, experimental design, behavioural techniques to assess learning and memory, molecular techniques to assess protein-level changes, statistical analysis, and the preparation of a scientific manuscript.",
