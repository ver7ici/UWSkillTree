    "description": "This course examines the social and neurobiological dimensions of eating. Using methods from behavioral sciences, neurosciences, and population health, we will explore the ways in which homeostasis, hedonic indulgence, social conformity together explain why we eat what we do. Topics will include brain representation of taste, neural and social dimensions of the flavour experience, self-control processes in eating, and neural gating and potentiation of social cognitive processes involving food.",
