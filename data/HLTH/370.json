    "description": "This course will examine the links between ecosystems, global ecological change, and the health and well-being of human communities. It will review the myriad ways in which the Earth, as a living system, is the ultimate determinant of human health. The course is divided into three parts: in the first part key environmental changes are addressed, including climate change, ecotoxicity, resource depletion, species extinction, and stresses on ocean systems as well as the social and human forces that drive these changes. The second part of the course focuses on the implications of these ecological changes and population health. The third part of the course will address potential solutions.",
