    "description": "The culminating experience in the UW MPH program, the Capstone provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate two very important dimensions of readiness to practice in public health:  the ability to work in a diverse and multidisciplinary team and the ability to integrate lessons learned from a variety of sources (including, but not limited to, course work and practicum) and bring them to bear on a concrete public health problem.  Graded on a Credit/Non-Credit basis.  (The course is delivered in a two-week block at the end of the MPH program sequence, on the UW main campus).",
