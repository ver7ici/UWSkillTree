    "description": "The accurate assessment of food and nutrition exposures and outcomes at the level of individuals and environments is fundamental to understanding eating patterns and the effectiveness of interventions to shape them. We will examine principles and methods of assessment, with a primary focus on food and nutrition but also consideration of related domains, such as physical activity. The principles addressed will have relevance to measurement of a range of domains (e.g., tobacco use, alcohol consumption).",
