    "description": "This course is an introduction to the key ideas and techniques of conformal field theories.  These theories play a central role In the study of phase transitions in statistical physics and condensed matter systems, as well as in string theory.  Conformal field theories provide a theoretical laboratory in which the constraints imposed by symmetries allow for the exact solution of field theories, which have found important applications in both physics and mathematics.",
