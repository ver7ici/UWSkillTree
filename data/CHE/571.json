    "title": "Industrial Ecology",
    "description": "Industrial Ecology is a rapidly growing field that systematically examines local, regional, and global uses and flows of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors, and economies. It focuses on the potential role of industry in reducing environmental burdens throughout the product life cycle from the extraction of raw materials to the production of goods, to the use of those goods and to the management of the resulting wastes. This course will review the environmental issues associated with chemical industries and the roles of engineers to manage these issues. The principles and philosophy of green chemistry will be addressed including pollution prevention in unit operations. The concepts and practices of environmental life cycle analysis and accounting will be addressed in detail, together with the basics of risk assessment, management and communication. [Offered: F]",
