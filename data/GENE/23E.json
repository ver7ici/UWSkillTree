    "description": "Courses taken at foreign universities by University of Waterloo engineering students while enrolled in an international exchange institution, and reserved for courses without equivalents at the University of Waterloo. To earn credit the exchange courses will include the exploration of the physical and chemical interactions of the natural world, and the systematic observation and understanding of physical and natural phenomena through analytical and/or experimental techniques. These courses are treated as natural science electives in the student's plan. Such courses are reported on the student's transcript with their original titles in English showing as the topic. The grades for these courses will be either CR or NCR.",
