    "title": "Environmental Isotope Hydrology and Geochemistry",
    "description": "This course explores the application of environmental isotopes (principally 2H, 13C, 15N, 18O,34S) as tracers of inorganic and organic processes and cycles in nature, with an emphasis on the use of isotope tracers in water and climate studies, including runoff generation analysis, isotope-mass balance studies, climatology and paleoclimatology, and in studies of biogeochemical cycling.  Other topics are tailored to student interest and research focus across the broad spectrum of geological, hydrological and biological questions that can be addressed using isotope techniques.  Note: Open to graduate students in physical and biological sciences, physical geography and engineering.",
