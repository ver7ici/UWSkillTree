    "title": "Global Biogeochemical Cycles",
    "description": "The global cycles of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus , sulfur, silicon and iron, are intimately linked to the chemical composition of the atmosphere and ocean, earth's climate, global biological productivity and diversity, and the evolution of sedimentary rocks.  This course focuses on the quantitative representation of the processes and mechanisms driving the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrient elements on both short (100-104 years) and long (>104 years) time scales.  Attention will also be given to the perturbation of biogeochemical cycles by human activity.  To explore the interactions between the processes, as well as between the elemental cycles themselves, we will use mass balance models.  Each student will carry out an independent project based on an elemental cycle of his/her choice.",
