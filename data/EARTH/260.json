    "description": "Applied geophysics provides geoscientists with a wide-range of non-invasive methods for characterizing the Earth's interior. This course is an introduction to the physical principles underlying field acquisition, processing, and data interpretation for commonly used applied geophysical techniques (seismic, electrical, electromagnetic induction, gravity, and magnetic methods). This course is not only pertinent for geoscientists but also for engineers and others interested in learning how physics can be used to explore the Earth's interior or perform non-destructive testing.
