    "description": "The course provides the fundamentals concepts of generation and measurements of high voltage ac, dc, and impulses. Briefly introduces the students to basic conduction and breakdown mechanisms of insulating materials. The scope of this course also includes understanding the basic protection system, studying the principles for protecting different elements and studying different technologies used in designing protective relays. Exposure to several state-of-art high voltage testing techniques of power system components will ensure that students have knowledge of the industrial solutions to the management of the problems associated with overvoltage and the protection mechanisms used.
