    "description": "Power system protections schemes are designed primarily to minimize the duration of a fault as well as to minimize the number of customers affect by the fault.  The scope of this course is to study the main elements and techniques for power system protection.  The course is divided into two main parts; protective equipment and protective techniques.  In the protective equipment; circuit breakers, relay, enclosures, fuses and isolating switches are discussed.  Different protection techniques dedicated to protect feeders, transformers, generators and motors are discussed in the second part of the course.  Recommended Background:  Basic knowledge in power system engineering is required, basic knowledge in optimization techniques, statistics, and electric circuits.",
