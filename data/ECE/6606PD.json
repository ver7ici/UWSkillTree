    "description": "This course deals with the essential aspects of distribution system engineering, starting with estimation of the loads on the network to the detail design of the distribution system networks.  The contents of this course are divided into three categories: Planning, design and operation.  In the planning part load forecasting, and planning strategies as well as distribution automation are discussed.  The design part includes the design of sub-transmission lines, distribution substations, and primary and secondary systems design considerations.  The operation part includes the voltage drop and power loss calculations, voltage regulation and application of capcitor to distribution systems.  Recommended Background:  Basic knowledge of power systems engineering is required, optimization techniques, statistics and electric circuits.",
