    "description": "As the cost of computing decreases at a phenomenal rate, the use of large format CCD area image sensors increases. Applications of CCD image sensors include industrial such as web inspection, document scanning, manufacturing product inspection for quality and process control, manufacturing product sorting and many other industrial applications. Multimedia and computers increasingly use their CCD image sensors or active pixel CMOS type image sensors. This course will start with the basic theory of CCD image sensors and graduate to CMOS type solid state image sensors. It will concentrate on the state of the art of this field and will deal with the basic device theory, the circuit design and architectures. Photosensitivity, noise, modulation transfer function and other aspects of spatial resolution will be covered. Related Background: E&CE semiconductor and circuit undergraduate courses.",
