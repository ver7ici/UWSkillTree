    "description": "This course will help you understand the foundational principles of FPGA architecture, the compilation and CAD process for modern FPGAs, high-level synthesis with OpenCL, communication overlay fabrics, and design strategies and patterns for computational acceleration. In particular, we will explore topics of contemporary interest such as machine learning that can influence both (1) how we design FPGAs, and (2) how they can be accelerated\nusing FPGAs.",
