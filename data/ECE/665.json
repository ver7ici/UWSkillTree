    "description": "This course deals with the new emerging technology in high voltage engineering. It is divided into five parts. The first part of the course in a review of the basic fundamentals of high voltage engineering. The second part deals with the new techniques in partial discharge measurements. The third part of the course deals with measurements of charge distribution in solid dielectric. The fourth part of the course discusses the optical fiber based monitoring techniques of the high voltage high power equipment. The last part of the course deals with the application of high voltage engineering in power systems.",
