    "description": "Vast urbanization and increasing pressure to meet high demand in power delivery have resulted in a significant growth in underground cable network.  In addtiion, underground cables being a critical asset group, any outages due to their failure will result in considerable service delivery and economic impact on the operation of distribution networks.  Understand the basic dielectric theory, material properties and design details of underground cables and their accessories.  Understand typical failure modes and their early detection of underground cable and their accessories.  Discuss in detail various off-line and on-line diagnostic tests for condition monitoring of underground cables.",
