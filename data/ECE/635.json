    "description": "The research in nanoscale science and technology has seen a very fast growth in the past years. The cornerstone for this exciting growth is the ability to create nanoscale patterns, which is the object of the current course. The course will cover all major nano-lithography technologies capable of generating or duplicating sub-lOOnm patterns, including lithographies based on photons, charged beams, scanning probes, replication and self-assembly. Within each lithographic technique, the students will learn its working principle, related materials and instrument, process and limit. This course is complementary to ECE 631 (Microelectronic Processing Technology), but takes fabrication and associated theory into nanoscale.",
