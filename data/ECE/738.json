    "description": "This course covers the system level design of integrated circuits for wireless transceivers. Specific mixed analog/digital circuits such as: mixers, A/D and D/A converters (Nyquist rate and oversampled) for IF digitizing as well as switched capacitor filters for IF and baseband processing will be studied. Related Background: Basic knowledge of Analog Integrated Circuits.",
