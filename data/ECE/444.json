    "description": "Analog electronics exploits the physical behaviour of electronic devices to create electronic systems. The performance of single and multiple transistor amplifying stages are studied. Followed by a study of biasing, current mirror, and output stages, which are then combined in the study of operational amplifier circuits. Frequency response and feedback are then reviewed leading to a detailed study of stability and compensation for multistage and operational amplifiers. The course finishes with a look at selected topics from A/D (analog-to-digital) converters, oscillators, and phase-locked loops. [Offered: W]",
