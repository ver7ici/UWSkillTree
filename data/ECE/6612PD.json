    "description": "FACTS controllers are studied in detail from the functional, structural and control points of view.  The course concentrates on studying the most common thyristor-controlled FACTS controllers, in particular Static Var Compensators (SVC), Thyristor-Controlled Series Compensators (TCSC) and Thyristor Controlled Voltage and Phase Regulators (TCVR and TCPAR), and voltage-sourced converter controllers, specifically the Static Compensator (STATCOM), Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) and the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC).  Detailed and approximate models for various control strategies and practical applications of these controllers are discussed.  Recommended Background:  Basic understanding of power electronic converters and power systems.",
