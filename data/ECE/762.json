    "description": "The basic structure, functional characteristics and protection schemes of the main components that make up a power system are studied, in particular generators, transformers, transmission lines, cables, loads, HVDC and FACTS controllers.  Models of these components for detailed electromagnetic transient analysis and phasor-based studies such as power flow and stability studies are discussed in detail, and various models are compared and validated through simulations performed with commercial software packages.  Required Background - ECE 631 or equivalent.",
