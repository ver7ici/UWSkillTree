    "description": "Course starts with a brief introduction to the theory of plasticity, directly applicable to the mathematical and physical analysis of problems in metal forming. A discussion of tribology and material attributes follows. Metallurgical phenomena, accompanying hot and cold forming of metals, are discussed. Application to bulk metal forming (rolling, extrusion, drawing and forging) and sheet metal forming (deep drawing, stretch forming, hydroforming) are considered. The use and limitations are demonstrated. Examples from laboratory experiments and from industrial applications are used to complement the presentation.",
