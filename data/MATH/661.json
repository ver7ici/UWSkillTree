    "description": "This course explores the Euclidean geometry of triangles and circles from elementary to advanced settings. The course also briefly discusses three-dimensional geometry. An emphasis is placed on proof, on problem solving, on problem creation in a geometric context, and on aspects of teaching geometry. Where possible, problems that combine multiple areas of mathematics are used.",
