    "description": "This course explores the relationship between planning instruments and the urban land use market. It relates urban outcomes to interactions between market processes and planning interventions. It is in this light that it interprets changing urban land use and transportation patterns since the late 1940s, as well as contemporary urban issues. These issues are chosen so as to underscore differences in the circumstances confronting different zones of urbanization (core, inner city, inner suburb, and outer suburb).",
