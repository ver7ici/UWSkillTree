    "description": "A seminar in Planning Law using the case study approach. Although the emphasis is primarily on the law in Ontario, reference is made to planning law in other provinces for purposes of comparison. Planning issues dealt with by the Ontario Municipal Board are used to illustrate the power to regulate the use of land, the law relating to citizen participation, problems of non-conforming uses, and the maintenance of environmental quality in neighbourhoods and communities. Some general familiarity with law is desirable, but not essential. Estimated additional cost to student: $40.00",
