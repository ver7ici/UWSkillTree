    "description": "This course will explore how remote sensing is used and in concert with empirical or physically-based models to help us better understand Earth system processes from the local to global scales.  Students will learn how remote sensing measurements are coupled with radiative transfer models, energy and mass balance models and spatial analytical models from different components of the Earth system.  Examples will be drawn from the hydrologic and carbon cycles from the human built enviornment.  Prerequisites: UW undergraduates: Geog 271, 371, 471 or undergraduate Geomatics degree.  Undergraduate degree with suitable remote sensing experience.  Students with no remote sensing experience but strong GIS experience are required to take a 675 Directed Reading course entitled  \"Remote Sensing Analysis\" prior to enrolment in 603. *eligible for MES.",
