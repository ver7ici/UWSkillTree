    "description": "Fundamental processes in physical hydrology are addressed. Components of the water balance are examined to determine the nature of their variation in time and space. Precipitation, interception, infiltration, groundwater and soil water processes, evapotranspiration, runoff and storage will be examined from a theoretical and practical viewpoint, and their linkages demonstrated by lab and fieldwork. [Note: Field trip fee normally $20+HST; will not exceed $55+HST.]",
