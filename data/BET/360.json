    "title": "Design Frameworks for Social Ventures",
    "description": "In this course, students will explore several design frameworks as they relate to complex problems; assess the impacts of these frameworks in recent entrepreneurial applications; and determine how to apply these concepts in the design of the social impact aspects of ventures and cross-industry collaborations. In parallel, students will be encouraged to develop skills, reflect on their own mindsets, and further their learning through workshops and studio sessions.  Several frameworks will be explored, including human centred design, life centred design, equity centred design, and inclusive design. [Offered: S, first offered Spring 2023]",
