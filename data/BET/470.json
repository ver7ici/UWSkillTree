The focus will be on those issues unique to family-businesses such as the interaction between family, management, and ownership. Family-controlled businesses are also characterized by challenges that put their continuity in serious jeopardy; and leadership and succession crises are the norm. Topics include, but are not limited to, the strengths and weaknesses of family businesses, managing family-business conflict, succession planning, professionalization, communication, new opportunity development, and strategic planning.
