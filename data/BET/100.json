    "description": "Successful entrepreneurs combine intellectual rigour with innovation to create solutions that have impact. It is a process that starts with a search for \"big ideas\" using tools such as research, observation, and appreciative inquiry. Next, entrepreneurs analyze situations and apply creativity techniques to develop solutions. Finally, solutions are tested against business drivers including customer value propositions, customer identification, channel selection, and resource needs. This course covers the three steps that form the foundation of all entrepreneurial success: big ideas, solutions, and testing. Because of its broad scope, the course is valuable to students from different academic backgrounds, entrepreneurship interests, and program level. [Note: Offered: F,W,S]",
