    "description": "This course examines disability through a social justice lens. Engaging with key texts in critical disability studies, students will explore how dominant ideas of embodiment, difference, expertise, and social value produce (dis)ableism and inequity. Through the social model of disability, it introduces concepts of access, inclusion, disability culture/justice, and universal design.",
