Building on foundational skills (i.e. basic understandings of epidemiology; the social determinants of health) the course will review a range of case studies (e.g. infectious disease; water; access to care; global environmental change) from a variety of regions around the world.  Students will gain an appreciation for the complexity of the issues, as well as science-policy bridging.",
