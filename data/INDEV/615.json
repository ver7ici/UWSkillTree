    "description": "There are approximately 265 river basins shared between and among states.  More than 40 percent of the world's population resides in a transboundary river basin.  While many speculate that wars of the future will be about water, many other suggest that water forms the basis for long-term inter-state cooperation.  This course describes and interrogates the adequacy of existing bilateral, regional and global laws, institutions and policies designed to organize the governance and management of transboundary waters in the world today.",
