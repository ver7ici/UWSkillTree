    "description": "Students will initiate an on-line record and assessment of their educational and work experience, tracked against two sets of criteria, the Student Performance Criteria established by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board and the Canadian Experience Record used by the provincial licensing bodies. The work-term reports are required courses for the degree but their grades are not included in the average. However, failed work-term report evaluations may delay a student's progress as indicated in the Examinations and Promotions section of this calendar. Details regarding the evaluation of the work-term reports can be obtained from the student's program advisor. \r\n[Note: This course is considered as DRNA]",
