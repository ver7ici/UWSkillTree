    "description": "This course will provide students with an overview of the rationale and stages involved in the conduct of a formal systematic review and meta-analysis of a well-defined clinical/health research question. The overarching aim is to provide students with the tools to critically appraise and conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis.  Students will largely work in pairs to progress through each step involved (with feedback from instructors at each stage) and to produce a final systematic review and meta-analysis to be presented/submitted at the end of the course.  \r\nCourse Objectives:\r\n1.  To demonstrate an understanding of the rationale underlying a systematic review and meta-analysis and relevance to clinical care and health policy;\r\n2.  To critically appraise a systematic review;\r\n3.  To develop a focused research question amenable to a systematic review;\r\n4.  To develop and implement a comprehensive and systematic literature search strategy;\r\n5.  To determine and apply procedures for including/excluding potential studies for a systematic review and meta-analysis;\r\n6.  To develop and implement a data abstraction process and study database;\r\n7.  To demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental statistical/biostatistical issues relevant to the conduct of a formal systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n8.  To perform statistical analyses for a systematic review and meta-analysis and complete/present a final report demonstrating all stages involved.\r\n\r\nStudents will need to meet with Course Coordinators and provide of appropriate previous experience with linear and/or logistic regression techniques.",
