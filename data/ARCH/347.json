    "description": "The course introduces the study of philosophical issues as they pertain to architecture, urbanism, image-making and symbol manipulation. The course focuses on the work of a selection of living and recent philosophers whose issues are relevant to questions of everyday 21st century life, with reference to their basis in the history of philosophy. Work by philosophers such as Giorgio Agamben, Kwame Anthony Appiah and Judith Butler on ethics, Gilles Deleuze on meaning, Friedrich Kittler on media and technology, Jean-Luc Nancy on community and Slavoj Zizek on psychoanalysis and political economy, as well as Canadian scholars such as Marshall McLuhan and Harold Innis is addressed. Students participate in a seminar format with a series of presentations linking their design projects with philosophical issues, and submit a final project making use of text and diagrams.
