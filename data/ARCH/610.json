    "description": "This course exposes students to research methodologies and diagrammatic strategies used for the analysis of works of architecture, approaches to design and key texts. These will act as case studies to learn about the conceptual ideas, formal/spatial principles, material systems and operative design strategies employed in the making of architecture while introducing students to analytical methods and processes considered integral to advanced research and design.  The rigorous consideration of precedent and design research methods fosters a deeper connection of students' work with the discipline, better enabling them to position their ideas within a larger conceptual discourse while giving them the methodological tools to prepare them for the undertaking of a research and design thesis.",
