    "description": "This course will introduce cultural history and the ethical dimension of the role architects play. Localizing the realities of modernity as an enduring cultural force and a global economy on one hand, with global threats to the future of humankind on the other. This course will explore the commonality of human experience, the interdependence of humans, and the natural environment. By considering narratives, artefacts, and buildings, this course will present how architecture and other cultural creations intersect with issues of race, gender, and identity, within a range of spiritual, social, political, and environmental contexts. Through orientation, disorientation, and reorientation, this course introduces human constructs and environmental conditions from a variety of perspectives such as location, foundation, habituation, accommodation, exile, and displacement.
