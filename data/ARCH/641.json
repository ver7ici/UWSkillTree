    "description": "The built world and the inner world are linked, and have the potential to touch us through the act of design.  The inspiration and meaning for the creative designs we need are available from the psyche but we have not been given the tools to access these resources and bring them into the built world.  The purpose of this elective is to connect architects with new pathways and creative tools for bringing their imagination into the world.  This course presents a psychological view of the built world in order to help architects understand the wisdom of their dreams, shadows and body during the process of design.  Its in-depth approach allows the architect to experience the act of design as inseparable from enriching the self.",
