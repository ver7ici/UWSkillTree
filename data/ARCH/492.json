    "description": "The studio course is mounted in Rome, Italy, with the school's own faculty and premises, and offers a unique opportunity to undertake design studies in a truly rich architectural heritage. The main focus is the nature of the institution and its relationship to the city and its culture. Students participating in the Rome term are expected to defray the costs of travel, accommodation, and food. For students unable to study in Rome, an alternative studio is offered in Cambridge. It presents similar design projects and theoretical questions in a North American context. [Note: Passing grade is 60%. Offered: F]",
