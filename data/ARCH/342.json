    "description": "This course examines the cultural, architectural, urban, and environmental history of those complex movements designated as \"modernism\". Through selected works, projects and texts, this course studies the changing social, industrial, aesthetic, and ecological ambitions of these movements, critically reviewing their development and examining forms of acceptance and resistance to the \"modern project\". Through the examination of selected Canadian and international artistic, cultural, architectural, and landscape works, this course questions the technological, political, and social ideologies that continue to inform our buildings and cities as well as our relation to the earth and environment. Using a thematic approach to address the complexity of modernization, modernism, and modernity, this course presents issues related to habitat, health, craft, economy, and labour; histories of displacement, global narratives, resistance movements, and processes of emancipation and decolonization.
