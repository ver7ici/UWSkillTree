    "description": "The course develops a trans-disciplinary overview to design approaches in architecture and urbanism using image- and symbol-making as key activities in designing environments. The course evaluates the quality of results and the quality of process of design of environments. The students address topics within a wide range of subject matter groupings, from sustainable architecture to engineering, landscape and infrastructure, to branding and aesthetic practices, to design within the municipal political forum. Students present seminars on diverse categories of design as a means to develop a personal design ethos. The final submission includes a set of drawings, diagrams and images that represent a set of design principles allowing students to consciously take a position in the world as a designer.
