    "description": "This course examines the intersection of business management, climate change, and the evolving policy environment within which mitigation and adaptation occurs. A Canadian lens is applied to understanding: climate change business economics; the changing policy and regulatory landscape at the international, national and provincial levels; the ways in which a price on carbon and the need to disclose carbon and climate risk can affect business decision-making; and various opportunities for companies to reduce their carbon footprint to operate in emerging low-carbon economies, make their business more resilient to the impacts of climate change, and identify value-creation opportunities. Leadership cases from businesses worldwide will be explored, including multi-nationals and small and medium sized enterprises.",
