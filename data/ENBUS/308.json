    "description": "Standards and auditing approaches used for sustainability management are examined. Public standards, like those from the International Organization for Standardization, are contrasted with private standards, developed by specific industries for product transparency and accountability in supply-chains. Auditing practice, as defined by the ISO 19011 standard, is examined including principles, steps, reporting and important concepts. Examples of performance standards and management system standards are explored, covering industrial, social and environmental issues. Lectures may be supplemented by required field trip(s) and/or field work. [Note: Field trip fee: up to $50+HST]",
