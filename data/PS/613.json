    "description": "This course introduces students to the policy challenges facing governments in a rapidly changing and increasingly diverse Canada.  A principal focus of the course is Canada's Aboriginal peoples, exploring topics such as aboriginal title and treaty rights, land claim settlements, poverty and powerlessness in cities and on reserve, debates over self-governance, and other matters that directly implicate federal, provincial and municipal governments.  The course also examines how the management of race and ethnicity is integrated into public policy and applied to the public service.  Topics may include the development and implementation of Canada's Multiculturalism program, immigration policy and politics, the principles and practices of institutional inclusion and reasonable accommodation, Employment Equity, and the dynamics of race, racism and anti-racism in Canada. This course is restricted to students enrolled in the Master of Public Service program.",
