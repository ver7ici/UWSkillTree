    "title": "Communicating with Diverse Audiences",
    "description": "Public servants often have to become communication specialists: they have to communicate with diverse audiences (e.g. citizen groups, politicians, lawyers, parliamentary committees and subcommittees) using a variety of genres (e.g. reports, records pamphlets, power point presentations, briefs) as well as different modes of communication (e.g. electronic, text, face-to-face).  This course offers participants an opportunity to identify and interrogate the stylistic and visual strategies characteristic of the documents in their workplaces.  Much of the course focuses on identifying the needs of different audiences and aligning stylistic and visual choices to those audiences.  In the process of investigating documentation practices, course participants are offered opportunities to develop their own informal and formal communication skills.  This course is restricted to students enrolled in the Master of Public Service program.",
