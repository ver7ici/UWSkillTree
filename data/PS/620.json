Using these four areas as a guide, this course offers future public servants a comprehensive interactive program aimed at developing their skills as managerial leaders.  Case studies drawn from government are examined and role-playing and problem-solving exercises are used to cultivate leadership capacity.  Students explore the roles of values and ethics in the life of a public servant, the need to build community and foster a culture of collaboration, and the necessity of being an effective communicator and leader of people.  This course is restricted to students enrolled in the Master of Public Service program.",
