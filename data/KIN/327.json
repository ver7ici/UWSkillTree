    "description": "This course provides students with an understanding of the mechanical behaviour of human tissues, with specific emphasis on the musculoskeletal system. Students will learn how to describe the mechanical properties of specific tissues. Emphasis will be placed on understanding how tissues are structured to meet their functional demands, and how they respond to traumatic, dynamic impact events. In addition, the content will cover engineering interventions to reduce the risk of traumatic injury (e.g., helmets, sporting equipment, transportation safety features such as seat belts and airbags), and orthopaedic devices to treat traumatic injuries, their underlying mechanical properties, and how they interact with biological tissues/systems.",
