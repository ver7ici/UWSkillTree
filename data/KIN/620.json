    "description": "This course examines the relationships between physical and organizational aspects of the work environment and occupational musculoskeletal fatigue and injuries. Emphasis will be placed on back and upper limb injuries. Major topics covered include injury mechanisms, assessment of injury risk, reporting of injury and use of injury statistics, work site interventions and evaluation of their effectiveness and relevant legislation (including Human Rights considerations). A laboratory project using the methodologies studied in the course is an important component of the course. A project within a local industry, instead of the laboratory project is preferred but optional.",
