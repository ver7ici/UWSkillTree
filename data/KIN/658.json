    "description": "This course provides a multi-disciplinary examination of the relationship between physical activity and cognition function. This will include discussion of the effects of physical activity and exercise on cognition functions, and how the effects are modified by age, exercise dose, and setting. We explore growing interest in the use of exercise as a cognitive rehabilitation strategy. In addition, the effects of cognitive impairment on movement and physical activity participation will be discussed from various perspectives (neurophysiological, biomechanical, psychosocial, and legislative).",
