    "description": "This graduate course will explore the biomechanical and motor control mechanisms that contribute to musculoskeletal and, where appropriate, neurological pathology and injury. This course will be delivered in a clinical case-based format. Students will review, critically appraise and apply neuromechanical methods (e.g., electromyography, motion capture, force measurement, modeling) to gain a deeper understanding of the pathology, assessment, and/or treatment of a clinical condition. Clinical conditions will include musculoskeletal, joint, and neurological pathologies resulting from disease and/or injury.",
