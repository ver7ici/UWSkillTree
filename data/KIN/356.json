    "description": "This course will examine how different regions of the nervous system interact to shape our perception, decisions, memories, movements, and consciousness. The focus will be placed on the role of the sensory systems in transducing external stimuli into neural activity, how sensory information is processed within and across sensory modalities (i.e., multisensory integration), and the implications for nervous system function. Topics will be considered from developmental, injury, disease, and aging perspectives.",
