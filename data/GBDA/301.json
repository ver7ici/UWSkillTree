    "description": "In this course, students will create critical design projects that explore the intersection of design, technology, and culture in a global context. Students will experiment with and prototype objects/systems that engage with contemporary ideas and technologies, while reflecting on how these objects/systems shape our everyday experiences. Students will be guided through one or more design cycles that unite design thinking with critical reflection through the practical application of theory. [Note: Offered at Stratford campus.]",
