    "description": "Mechanical engineering aspects of tribology are emphasized. Topics include the fundamentals of fluid film lubrication and contact mechanics. These fundamentals are applied to model friction, surface temperatures, boundary lubrication, mixed film lubrication, elastohydrodynamic lubrication and wear. Specific applications may be presented, if time permits. ME 423 is a recommended but not an essential prerequisite.",
