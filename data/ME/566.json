    "description": "A course to develop the understanding required to simulate complex fluid flows, such as those found in turbo-machines, duct systems, and other engineering hardware. Course topics include the physics of complex viscous fluid flows, first- and second-order finite control volume discretization methods, iterative algorithms for the solution of sparse matrix equation sets, including multi-grid acceleration, boundary condition modelling, two-equation and Reynolds stress turbulence models, and grid generation techniques. Computational fluid dynamics software is used throughout the course to simulate and analyze complex fluid flows relevant to engineering applications. [Offered: F,S]",
