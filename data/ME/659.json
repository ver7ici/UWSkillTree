    "description": "Review Canada's and the world's energy situation from energy reserve availability, to consumption trends, to environmental impact. Energy resources covered include fossil fuels, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal, and others. The technological capabilities and challenges associated with, and physics and engineering principles behind, a range of energy conversion systems are covered. The energy conversion systems covered are fossil fuel systems, nuclear fission power plants, photovoltaic and thermal solar collector systems, wind energy systems, and a range of other systems as appropriate from wave and tidal energy to fuel cells. The thermodynamics of energy conversion systems is considered from the perspectives of optimization and improving energy conversion efficiency. May be held with ME 459 (Energy Conversion) but with enhancements for the ME 659 students. Also offered Online.",
