    "description": "The first of two required courses for the mechanical engineering capstone design project. This course is intended to enable students to engage in in-depth engineering design and decision-making using engineering science while encouraging creativity and resourcefulness, and addressing the criteria listed in the faculty of engineering design rubrics. Students will work in small groups on a design project of their own choosing, or as part of a major student team project. The goal is to develop a design proposal, consisting of the needs analysis, design specifications and project plan, followed by the initial and detailed design work. [Offered: F,S]",
