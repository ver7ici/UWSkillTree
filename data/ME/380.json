    "title": "Mechanical Engineering Design Workshop",
    "description": "In this course, students study the design process, including needs analysis, problem definition; design criteria and critical parameter identification, generation of alternative solutions; conceptual design, detailed design, optimization; and implementation. Most of the term is devoted to a significant design project in which student groups work independently and competitively, applying the design process to a project goal set by the faculty co-ordinator. The design project typically includes construction of a prototype, and part of the course grade may depend on the performance of the prototype in a competitive test. In exceptional circumstances, the requirement for a prototype may be replaced by a computer simulation, or may be waived. Other mechanical engineering faculty members, particularly those teaching 3B courses, are available to provide advice and supervision to ME 380 students. [Offered: F,W]",
