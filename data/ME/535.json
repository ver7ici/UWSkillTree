    "description": "Metallurgy of welding of steels (carbon, microalloy, low alloy and stainless steels), cast irons, aluminum-based, copper-based, nickel-based, cobalt-based, titanium-based and other alloys, (including dissimilar combinations) to explain the effects of welding processes and conditions (including post-weld heat treating) on microstructure and properties; causes and prevention of defects and deficiencies which can occur in different alloys, including porosity, cracking, embrittlement (hydrogen, temper, strain aging, ductile-brittle transition temperatures), overaging; metallurgy of soldered and brazed joints. Laboratory experiments will demonstrate microstructural effects and defects in a range of alloys for different welding processes and conditions. [Offered: W]",
