    "description": "This course presents the principles behind the mathematical representation of surfaces in ways that are suitable for computers, together with the application of such representations to computer-controlled machining processes. The Bezier, B-spline and NURBS representations are all covered, as are important surface properties, like curvature, shortest-distance algorithms, ray-intersection, surface sub-division, knot insertion, and degree elevation. Machining aspects covered are three-, four- and five-axis methods, anti-gouging methods and anti-interference checking.",
