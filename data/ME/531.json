    "description": "This course will allow the student to develop a more in depth knowledge of physical metallurgy and its application in understanding and solving relevant manufacturing problems. It will begin with a treatment of solid-state diffusion, mass transport and the principles of solidification including constitutional supercooling. This knowledge will then be applied to understand the microstructural development (and resultant properties) which occur in materials during manufacturing processes including casting, solid-state heat treatments, laser processing, and various joining operations. The course will include case studies aimed at providing the students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge in a practical way. [Offered: W]",
