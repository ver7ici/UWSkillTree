    "description": "Linear elastic, elastic-plastic and fully plastic approaches to the analysis of cracked components. Calculation and measurement of fracture mechanics parameters - Charpy, strain energy release rate, stress intensity factor, crack tip opening displacement and J-integral - will be covered, including correlations between the various parameters and limitations on their use. Applications will include the analysis of sub-critical crack growth (fatigue) and design procedures, especially the failure assessment diagram approach.",
