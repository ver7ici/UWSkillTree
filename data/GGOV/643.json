    "description": "Health policy-making is changing to reflect a need for more coordination among nation-states and a rising number of international non-governmental organizations, leading to a more polycentric form of global governance.  It begins with a review of theoretical texts on globalization and global public policy that assist in understanding changes in scale for policy-making and for policy coordination.  It then looks at the historical development of global institutions, including the World Health Organization.  Finally, it examines case studies of global health policy making, noting how these actions interface with nation-states' sovereignty and autonomy, and with other sites of global authority.",
