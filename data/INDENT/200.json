    "description": "The Indigenous peoples of this land have always been expert entrepreneurs. Indeed, European colonization was driven by the desire to engage in trade with Indigenous peoples who had complex commercial practices and supply chains long before contact. This course will provide an overview of Indigenous entrepreneurship from the pre-contact era through the present, and will investigate its future prospects. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which Indigenous approaches to commercial activity have differed from mainstream approaches.",
