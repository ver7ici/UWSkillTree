    "description": "This laboratory course introduces students to six materials characterization techniques employed routinely by nanotechnology engineers in their practices. Specifically, the six techniques are: Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman light-scattering, and ultra-violet and visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopies, ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This course is intended to familiarize students with the instrumentation involved, prior to its application to nanomaterials in a follow-up laboratory course, NE 320L. [Offered: S]",
