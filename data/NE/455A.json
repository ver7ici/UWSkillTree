    "description": "Application of experimental tools and techniques in nano-electronics. Experimental exercises to complete the design cycle involve printed circuit board (PCB) assembly and soldering, measurement of the formation of a nonanethiol self- assembled monolayer, determination of the partition coefficient for a solvent vapour into a monolayer-protected-cluster film deposited on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and the use of various characterization methods. These exercises also stress the safe handling of chemicals in the process. [Offered: W]",
