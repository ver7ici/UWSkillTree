    "description": "An internship allows students to engage in experiential learning with an organization that deals with peace and conflict issues, in either a Canadian or international context. The course integrates theory and practice, while facilitating the development of attitudes, strategies, skills, and knowledge that support work in a Peace and Conflict Studies-related setting. Students will identify an appropriate placement, read relevant texts, and submit a report reflecting on what the internship revealed about the integration of peace and conflict studies theory and practice. [Note: Additional costs should be expected.]",
