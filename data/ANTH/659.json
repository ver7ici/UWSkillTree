    "description": "Biological anthropology has a long history of examining our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates.  Increasingly, these species are threatened by extinction, which brings to light larger questions regarding our place in the natural world.  Anthropology is uniquely positioned to examine the interaction between efforts to conserve biodiversity and natural resources, community rights, and globalization.  This course will focus on attempts to balance the preservation of nature within the health and socioeconomic well-being of neighbouring communities, and how these relationships are affected by processes of globalization.  Other topics such as the effects of climate change, heritage management, and indigenous rights may be addressed. [Note: Department Consent required]",
