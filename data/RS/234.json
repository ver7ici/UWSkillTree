    "description": "This course will examine the uses and abuses of power in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) by analyzing the historical narratives of the conflict between Saul and David, as well as the rise and fall of King David. In doing so, it will deal with the period of the prophets, i.e., the books of Joshua, Kings, and Samuel. [Note: Knowledge of Hebrew is not required. This course fulfils an Area 1 or Area 2 requirement for Religious Studies majors but not both.]",
