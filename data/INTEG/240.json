    "description": "Misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, dishonest political ads, and bullshit (i.e., communication intended to persuade without any concern for truth). It seems it's harder than ever to know what to believe and what makes some claims more credible or trustworthy than others. This course is an introduction to information literacy and the art and science of spotting bullshit and other types of false claims. The course will cover a broad range of issues from a social scientific perspective, including comparisons of different types of deceptive information; the role that cognitive biases and social networks play in shaping our perceptions of truth and reality; the importance of data rights, privacy, and governance models for social media platforms and other digital communications; misrepresentations of science; and how influence campaigns undermine political deliberation and democratic institutions. This course will provide students with knowledge and fundamental skills that are important for countering bullshit, biases, and bad arguments.",
