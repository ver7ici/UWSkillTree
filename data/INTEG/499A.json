    "description": "The first part of a two-term independent studies course provides opportunities for students to work closely with faculty members in an area of interest to the student. Students taking this course for the Collaborative Design Experience will work as a design group to address a problem over the course of the two-term sequence with the instructor in an advisory role. Students are encouraged to identify and meet with a real-world client, typically from outside the university, to understand the client's problem and needs. The focus of the first term will be background research (e.g., a comprehensive design brief) and the presentation of one or more proposed solutions for the client's or supervisor's approval.",
