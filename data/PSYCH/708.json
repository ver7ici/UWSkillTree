    "title": "Reasoning about Ownership of Property",
    "description": "Ownership of property is an important determinant of human behaviour.  It is especially important in development because most of young children's social conflicts concern the possession and use of objects and these conflicts often involve reasoning about ownership. This class will examine the development of reasoning about ownership.  Although the main approach will be developmental, a multidisciplinary approach will be taken.  Readings will include papers from other areas of psychology and from philosophy, anthropology, law, and ethology.",
