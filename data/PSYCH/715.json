    "description": "This course will provide an intensive training experience in the clinical foundations of family systems theory and family therapy practice. Classical and contemporary theoretical and research applications will provide fundamentals surrounding the systemic view of human functioning that gives rise to a particular form of intervention (i.e., the family therapies). Clinical formulation will be heavily emphasized, and family-based formulation will be compared and contrasted with individual psychological formulation. Students will develop a holistic perspective on \"family therapy intervention\", with particular emphasis on Structural and Emotion-Focused Family Therapy. Direct clinical work and case review will be emphasized. Specifically, students will have opportunity for direct (i.e., \"face to face\") clinical contact, either with their own or a shared (co-therapy) client at the CMHRT. Only students in the Clinical Psychology program are permitted to take this course. Graded on a CR/NCR basis.",
