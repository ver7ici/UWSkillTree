    "description": "This winter course is a weekly practicum during which students are exposed to diagnostic assessment, decision making, and practice. This course includes didactic learning, reading, case conferencing and supervised practice. Students will develop a diagnostic knowledge base that includes the DSM diagnostic categories and differential diagnoses, as well as diagnostic mindset about how to approach diagnostic interviewing. Students will be trained under supervision to screen for, identify, and develop working hypotheses about differential diagnoses. They will also begin developing proficiency in communicating diagnostic impressions to both colleagues (via participation in weekly intake meeting and the preparation of diagnostic summary sheets/reports) as well as clients (via observation of/participation in diagnostic feedback sessions). Only students in the Clinical Psychology program are permitted to take this course. Graded on a CR/NCR basis.",
