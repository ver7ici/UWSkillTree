    "description": "This course considers psychological theories and research that focuses on the behavior of people at work. In particular, there will be an emphasis on the psychology of the individual at work (often referred to as the \"micro\" component of organizational psychology). Accordingly, topics examined will be self-regulation, negotiation, ethics, and citizenship behavior. By necessity, coverage of these topics will not be comprehensive; the primary goal of the course is to simply introduce students to a broad range of theories and topics that are relevant to organizational psychology.",
