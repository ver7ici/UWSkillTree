    "description": "The student will be placed in the Early Childhood Education Centre (ECEC) or one of several community locations, depending on availability and at their discretion following an interview in September with interested students. The practicum will comprise 1 half day a week for the duration of the term. In each location, students will work 'in program' alongside the educators and/or professionals and/or staff. The Community Practicum will serve to provide students with 'hands-on' experience in an applied setting relevant to their educational and professional goals and provide an opportunity to witness children's learning  as it relates to what students have learned, and are currently investigating, in the field of child development science and communicative development.",
