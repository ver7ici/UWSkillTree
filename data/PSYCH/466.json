    "description": "Emergent literacy refers to the knowledge and skills children acquire from birth on through the preschool years that are important to the development of literacy (reading and writing). Students will learn about emergent literacy via a once-weekly seminar component and a once-weekly unpaid practicum placement at a local elementary public school where students will have the opportunity to read one-on-one with children who are at the beginning stages of reading. The practicum component will involve a commitment of up to 30 hours during the formal lecture period. Students wishing to enter the course must obtain a police check prior to the second week of classes. Transportation to the apprenticeship/volunteer setting is the student's responsibility. Please review the course application form for information on safety for students on unpaid work placement and insurance responsibilities. Course application forms and further details are available on the Psychology undergraduate website. Paid or volunteer positions that are obtained outside the context of this course are not eligible for credit in this course.",
