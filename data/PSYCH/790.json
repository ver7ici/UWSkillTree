    "description": "The cognitive disorders that follow brain damage are an important source of insight into the neural bases of human cognitive functioning.  The single-case approach in neuropsychology has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the architecture of the brain and its functions.  In this course we will review the history, principles and methods used by neuropsychologists to understand perception, attention, memory, language, and consciousness.  Disorders of perception and vision such as agnosias, of attention such as neglect, of language such as apshasias and dyslexias, of memory as in dementias, and amnesia, and of higher-order functions as in callosal split brain patients will be considered.  We will also examine the relationship between findings from case studies and neuroimaging of cognitive functions.  By reviewing and discussing theoretical implications of classic and current research in neuropsychology, students will develop an understanding of how a patient-based approach can inform current theories of human cognition.",
