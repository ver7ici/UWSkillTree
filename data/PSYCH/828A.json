    "description": "Principles derived from research in social psychology are widely used in applied contexts. As such, training in social psychology opens a number of doors for non-academic career paths. This graduate practicum offers an advanced experiential learning opportunity that complements the student\u00bfs interests with respect to research and/or possible career paths be they in academia or outside academia. The practicum setting is to be proposed by the student to the faculty head of the social area and the time spent in this setting should be a minimum of 50 hours over the term (approximately 1 morning or afternoon a week). This proposal should outline the planned location for the practicum, a primary contact, and the nature of practicum and its relation to the student\u00bfs academic or professional goals, and the proposed time. The plans for evaluation will be determined, on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the student\u00bfs advisor and the head of the area. Some assistance may be available from the area in locating a possible practicum setting. Via this practicum, students will gain experience applying their research skills in an applied context, learn new skills relevant to applied research and/or knowledge translation, and expand their professional networks. This practicum does not count towards the breadth requirement for students in Social.",
