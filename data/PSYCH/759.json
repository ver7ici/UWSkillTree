    "description": "Research in cognitive psychology is comprised of a wide array of methods and approaches.  Researchers able to effectively use this diverse toolkit are better positioned to solve important problems in cognitive psychology.  The goal of this course is to provide students with novel experiences conducting research in cognitive psychology.  To this end, contingent on the availability of appropriate opportunities, students will work in a laboratory outside that of their primary research advisor on an independent research project relevant to cognitive psychology.  Through this course, students will gain experience applying new methods and approaches in cognitive psychology, learn new research skills, and expand their professional networks.",
