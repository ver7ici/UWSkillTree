    "description": "This course is designed to provide graduate students in Psychology with the background and skills to be able to interpret and conduct multi-level data analysis.  Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) software will be used for instruction and assignments.  Conceptual issues with multi-level data and theory will also be addressed.  Applications may involve data concerning work groups in organizations, romantic couples, individual change over time (as in learning growth curves), and event-level associations of mood states with other variables (as in \"diary\" studies).  Extensions to 3-level models and to \"non-linear\" models (e.g., for count and rate data) will also be discussed.",
