    "description": "This seminar provides an overview of classic and contemporary social psychological theory and research on intergroup relations\u00bfnamely, how groups of people and people from different groups interact, as well as when and why diversity can pose challenges or cause conflict. We will also examine major theories of intergroup conflict, interdependence, intergroup ideology power, and group position, as well as the interpersonal dynamics of intergroup interactions from both majority- and minority-group members\u00bf perspectives. We will use this foundation to think broadly about the implications of social psychological research and theory has to say about how people manage (and mismanage) diversity. Specifically, we will discuss implications for promoting intergroup trust, reducing inequality, and resolving real-world conflict.",
