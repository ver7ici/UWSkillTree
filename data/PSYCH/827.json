    "description": "Training in industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology follows the scientist-practitioner model, and careers after graduation for students in our program can include non-academic career paths (e.g., consulting, applied research). Therefore, it is beneficial that students have the opportunity to practice applying principles derived from research in I/O and to develop their practitioner skills in more applied organizational contexts. The practicum setting is to be proposed by the student to the faculty head of the I/O area and the time spent in this setting should be a minimum of 50 hours over the term (approximately 1 morning or afternoon a week). This proposal should outline the planned location for the practicum, a primary contact, and the nature of practicum and its relation to the student\u00bfs academic or professional goals, and the proposed time. The plans for evaluation will be determined, on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the student\u00bfs advisor and the head of the area. This practicum does not count towards the breadth requirement for students in the I/O program. Additionally, this practicum is meant to complement rather than replace the internship requirement for I/O MASc students.",
