    "description": "Cancer causes wide-ranging impacts on sexual health and well-being and numerous studies have identified that people affected by cancer want support, education and counseling in this area. While health professionals consistently acknowledge that sexuality is within their scope of practice, few health professionals consistently assess or intervene in sexual health problems in cancer settings. This course is designed to provide graduate students in the health professions with the knowledge and skills to intervene with the sexual problems that arise in cancer.",
