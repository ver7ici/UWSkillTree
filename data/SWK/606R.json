    "description": "The goal of this course is to deepen students' knowledge of the ways in which research can be produced, used, and disseminated in social work practice. The course will address research ethics, theories, and methods, and examine how different approaches can influence relationships and practices across community and health care settings. Students will develop their abilities to assess existing research studies, and will explore how they can engage in new research as social workers. Activities include literature reviews, interviews, surveys, and knowledge dissemination strategies. Particular attention will be paid to program evaluation and knowledge mobilization, and to how these may be used to improve services and further social justice in students' own organizations and communities. (Note: This is an online course).",
