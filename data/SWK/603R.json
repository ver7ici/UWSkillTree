    "description": "This course examines the theories and practice skills of effective social work leadership within health care contexts, social service organizations, and community service delivery systems. The effective and responsible use of human and material resources are emphasized through a social justice lens, while knowledge and skills for ethical and value-based leadership in staff management and organizational change processes, coordination of inter-professional teams, creating a positive organizational culture, and policies to address the social determinants of health are addressed. Supervision will be examined as one form of leadership, where functions and skills of supervisory practice and the organizational contexts will be considered. Learners will be invited to critically examine and expand their own leadership style and skills via an inquiry-based approach, while developing foundational knowledge and skills for best practices in organizations. Development of styles of leadership, management and supervision that are respectful, reflective, and relational in nature are encouraged. (Note: This is an intensive on campus course with an online component).",
