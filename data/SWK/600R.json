    "description": "This course explores health inequity within a Canadian context. It engages critical debates on key concepts related to health inequity including diversity, equity, access, and inclusion. The ultimate goal of this examination is to support students understanding of the social and structural determinants of health and the ways in which uneven access to these determinants are implicated in health inequities for equity-seeking groups, and consequently, social injustice. The course centers the learner as a pivotal agent in changing social structures that sustain health inequities. (Note: This is an intensive on campus course with an\nonline component).",
