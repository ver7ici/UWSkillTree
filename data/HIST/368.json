    "description": "This course examines the history of Africa in the 20th century, a time of tremendous upheaval and change on the continent. In the first half of the course, students will learn about the introduction and expansion of colonial rule, considering how the colonial state was imagined, enacted, experienced, and overthrown. The second half of the course focuses on the postcolonial period, illuminating how states and citizens navigated the challenges and opportunities that emerged following independence. Within each part of the course, students will learn about a range of case studies from multiple regions of the continent. Overall, students will engage with the key debates, themes, and methods that have shaped the study of twentieth-century Africa, focusing in particular on questions of identity, state-building, resistance, gender, violence, and memory.",
