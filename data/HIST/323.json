    "title": "Global History of the Prison",
    "description": "This course examines the global history of the prison, from its origins in the 18th and 19th centuries to contemporary debates about mass incarceration and the use of punishment as a form of social control. Students will explore how the prison became a nearly universal institution, considering the ways in which colonialism was a driving force for its expansion. They will examine how colonial powers presented prisons as symbols of \"civilization\" and \"modernity,\" as well as how they became sites of anti-colonial resistance. Students will investigate these themes through case studies drawn from a range of geographical areas and time periods. A variety of sources will be used including academic texts, memoirs, media, poetry, visual sources, music, and film. The course will develop students' methodological skillset and their ability to critically examine the connections between penal institutions, power, and knowledge production. Overall, this course will help students to understand the place of the prison in our global society, past and present.",
