    "title": "Human Rights in Historical Perspective I",
    "description": "The course will examine developments in human rights, primarily during the twentieth century.  Weekly discussions based on assigned readings will offer students an opportunity to explore such questions as:  What are \"human rights\" and how are they different from any other rights?  Where do human rights come from?  Why do they change over time, and by whom and by what means are changes effected?  Is there a role for the historian in explaining this process, and can the lessons of history be applied to public policy and to continuing human rights issues?  The focus for our study is the formation and evolution of international human rights, but with attention paid to Canadian events to assess the relationship between domestic and global human rights innovations.",
