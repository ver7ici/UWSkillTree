    "description": "This course borrows its title from the famous collection of essays edited by Edward Muir and Guido Ruggiero.  The course explores how historians use narrative to (re)construct past realities.  It looks closely at the uses, abuses, and limitations of microhistory as a genre and exposes students to important trends in social history.  Though the bulk of the material deals with Europe in the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries, the course is methodological in nature and is intended for all graduate students of social history.\r\n\r\nStudents in HIST 622 read the great microhistories including Davis' The Return of Martin Guerre, LeRoy Ladurie's Montaillou and Caranaval at Romans, Spence's The Death of Woman Wang, Ginzburg's Night Battles, and others.  Through these sources students acquire a deep understanding of the historiography surrounding this genre.  In addition, HIST 622 exposes students to the various non-historical theorists (sociological, anthropological, etc.) whose works inform the microhistorical method.",
