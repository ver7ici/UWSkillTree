    "description": "The course explores the concept of nationalism and the responses of multiethnic states to nationalist challenge.  Students will examine theories of nationalism and discuss its creative and destructive potential.  Pursuit of national self-determination led to the birth of new states and the disintegration of old ones: ethnic tensions were another product of nationalism.  Different types of states have addressed ethnic problems in different ways: some have sought to maintain harmonious multicultural communities: others have preferred to assimilate or segregate minorities; yet others have engaged in ethnic cleansing.  We will trace the roots of nationalism and the consequences of its rise, and we will also discuss the impact of state system on the ethnic policy.",
