    "title": "First Order Logic and Computability",
    "description": "The concepts of formal provability and logical consequence in first order logic are introduced, and their equivalence is proved in the soundness and completeness theorems.  Goedel's incompleteness theorem is discussed; making use of the halting problem of computability theory.  Relative computability and the Turing degrees are further studied.",
