    "title": "Pattern Recognition",
    "description": "Pattern recognition addresses the problem of detecting and classifying patterns in data, a process of machine perception in which objects are assigned to classes to which they are most similar. This course introduces the three modern approaches to pattern recognition: statistical, structural and neural. Specific topics include distance and probability based approaches in multidimensional feature spaces, feature extraction, clustering and performance measures; pattern grammars, syntax analysis and grammatical inference; connectionist models, pattern associators, back propagation and self-organizing networks.",
