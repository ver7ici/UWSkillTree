    "description": "This course covers the core topics needed to estimate linear models using ordinary least squares and to interpret estimates for cross-sectional data. Students will learn to interpret the coefficients of linear models for continuous and discrete regressors, to conduct reliable inference for different specifications of the error term, and to determine which model is the most suitable among the class of linear models. Students will be introduced to a statistical software package and will be required to complete regular computer-based assignments throughout the course using economic data.",
