    "description": "This course examines public policies in imperfectly competitive markets.  The focus is on how different public policies impact dynamic welfare through their effects on innovation.  The course explores the role of innovation in antitrust policy, examines in detail different forms of  intellectual property rights, and introduces students to concepts such as  technological opportunity, induced innovation, and preference externalities.  Throughout  the course the methodological emphasis is on studying when economic research - whether theoretical or empirical - can inform public policy.",
