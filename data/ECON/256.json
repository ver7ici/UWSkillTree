    "description": "Why are some people healthy and others not? Why is health different from other goods and services? How do the many stakeholders interact in health care markets? Why do countries have different health care systems? This course introduces students to how the theories and tools of economics can be used when examining health, health care, and health care policies. Concepts such as supply and demand, uncertainty, and utility will be introduced in the context of health and health care markets. While international institutions may be discussed, the course will emphasize Canadian health care markets.",
