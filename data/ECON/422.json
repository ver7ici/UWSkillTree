    "description": "This course investigates advanced estimation and inference techniques for microeconomic data. Students will learn about error components models that are used for economic data that exhibits significant unobserved heterogeneity. The estimation of treatment effects using fixed effects and difference-in-differences methods will be covered, and design-based methods of causal inference such as matching and regression discontinuity may be covered as well. Extensions such as multilevel or hierarchical models, limited dependent variable models, duration models or selection models may also be included. Students also learn how to apply these methods using computer software, and will use it to analyze complex data from household and firm-level surveys in assignments.",
