    "description": "Many economic decisions are made in circumstances where there are no competitive markets. This course introduces students to individual and group choice in such settings. It covers how to model such settings as \"games\" in both the extensive and strategic form, and introduces the key equilibrium concepts associated with these models. An introduction to considerations in group decision making via cooperative game theory and welfare economics is provided in the last part of the course.",
