    "description": "In this course students will engage in Black speculative thought by engaging such questions as: what would the world have been like if Africa had colonized Europe? What if the \"Other\" was White? How and why do these questions make the public uncomfortable, and at the same time pique curiosities about the many \"what ifs\" that could have turned history? This course will challenge students to consider a world where the power dynamics are flipped. Special consideration will be given to histories of enslavement and colonialism, with a specific focus on the Black experience in Canada.",
