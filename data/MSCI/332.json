    "description": "This course builds on the material presented in MSCI 331, and explores more advanced optimization techniques and applications. Methods, such as integer optimization, dynamic programming, and heuristics, are introduced and used to design solution alternatives for applications from management engineering. This may include network and process design in logistics, transportation, telecommunications, and healthcare. [Offered: F]",
