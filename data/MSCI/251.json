    "description": "A first of a two-course sequence that introduces fundamental concepts in probability and statistics. It covers probability concepts, random variables, graphical display of distributions and data, discrete and continuous probability distributions, sampling, estimation, confidence intervals, experimental design, hypothesis testing, and simple linear regression and correlation. Students learn how to graphically explore data, conduct, and analyze a two-treatment experiment, and model data with linear regression, and interpret its fit. Students learn to use statistical computing software (e.g., R) to perform data analyses. Emphasis is placed on gaining experience with data collected from student-conducted experiments.
