    "description": "The second of a two-course sequence that introduces probability and statistics. It covers quantitative information displays, conditional probability and Bayes' rule, transforms, joint distributions, special discrete and continuous distributions (t, F, chi-square, Poisson), fitting distributions to data, maximum likelihood estimation, multiple regression, experimental design (blocking, factorial), paired hypothesis tests, analysis of variance, non-parametric statistics, and computer intensive statistics (bootstrap). In addition, students learn how to clean data, handle missing values, smooth data, and perform the statistical techniques covered in the course using a statistical computing package (e.g., R). Emphasis is placed on working with actual data collected from student experiments and other sources such as industrial partners. [Offered: S]",
