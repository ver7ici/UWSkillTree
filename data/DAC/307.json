    "description": "This course focuses on the creative, technical, and artistic challenges inherent to creating visual content (film, photos, graphics) for the increasingly ubiquitous out-of-home digital displays. The size, configuration, placement, and functions of these public digital displays require new artistic and technical techniques to fully exploit their capabilities. In the course students will explore the design affordances of several types of public digital display as well as produce dynamic, interactive content for them.",
