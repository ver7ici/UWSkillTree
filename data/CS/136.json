    "description": "This course builds on the techniques and patterns learned in CS 135 while making the transition to use an imperative language. It introduces the design and analysis of algorithms, the management of information, and the programming mechanisms and methodologies required in implementations. Topics discussed include iterative and recursive sorting algorithms; lists, stacks, queues, trees, and their application; abstract data types and their implementations. [Note: See Note 2 above. Offered: F,W,S]",
