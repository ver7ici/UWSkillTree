    "description": "This number is used for courses being offered on a temporary basis. Such a course may be available only once, for example to take advantage of a visiting professor's expertise, or may be offered experimentally until it is determined whether of not the course should become part of the regular course offerings. It may also be used for an individual study course carried out under the supervision of a Computer Science faculty member with the approval from the Associate Chair, Graduate Studies. This is a grade course. Preference will be given to CS graduate students.  All others require approval of the Department.",
