    "description": "Introduction to modeling and algorithmic techniques for machines to learn concepts from data.  Generalization:  underfitting, overfitting, cross-validation. Tasks: classification, regression, clustering.  Optimization-based learning:  loss minimization, regularization.  Statistical learning: maximum likelihood, Bayesian learning.  Algorithms: nearest neighbor, (generalized) linear regression, mixtures of Gaussians, Gaussian processes, kernel methods, support vector machines, deep learning, sequence learning, ensemble techniques.  Large scale learning:  distributed learning and stream learning.  Applications: Natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, human computer interaction, information retrieval.",
