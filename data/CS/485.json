Central concepts: VC-dimension, margins of a classifier, sparsity and description length, other types of regularization. Performance guarantees: generalization bounds, data dependent error bounds, and computational complexity of learning algorithms. Common paradigms: neural networks, kernel methods and support-vector machines, boosting, nearest neighbor classifiers. Applications to data mining.",
