    "description": "This course is designed to introduce students to the culture of 18th-century Europe. Particular attention is paid to France and Britain but these countries are discussed within the wider context of Europe and, at times, much of the world. By looking at the art, artists, patrons, and collectors, some of the issues that will be discussed include cosmopolitanism, nationalism, empire-building, \"taste\", consumerism, and women in society.
