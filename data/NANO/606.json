    "description": "Course builds critical understanding in microfabrication, MEMS actuation and sensing mechanisms. Microelectromechanical systems and devices,  including microactuators, microsensors, micro-domain forces, microfabrication and their actuation principles. Application domains of MEMS in RF, optics and biosensing. Specific topics include MEMS actuation mechanisms such as electrostatic, electromagnetic, thermal and piezoelectric, and sensing mechanisms such as piezoresistive, capacitive, optical and bio-transducer. Lithography, thinfilm deposition methods and etching techniques will be taught. Course covers practical examples, device architecture, fabrication design rules and fabrication procedures.",
