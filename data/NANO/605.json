Analytical tools to explore the possibilities of NEMS. Includes methodology to derive and use MEMS and NEMS models as design tools, basic concepts of statics and dynamics needed to construct lumped-mass models, the use of reduced-order models in MEMS/NEMS design, advantages and disadvantages of these techniques versus commercial software (COMSOL, ANSYS, and Coventor), most effective uses and limitations for each modeling approach.",
