    "description": "This course provides a framework for understanding a developing country through a comparative study with Canada. The collective responses of citizens in meeting community needs in the context of colonial legacies and contemporary global influences are highlighted in both settings. The international learning experience usually takes place during Reading Week and is complemented by three days of pre-trip learning focusing on Canadian realities and one post-trip day to reflect upon the comparative analysis.
