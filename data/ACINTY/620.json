    "description": "Every new UW graduate student must complete this online academic integrity module in their first academic term.  Regardless of the term when the new student starts he/she will be automatically enrolled in the academic integrity module in LEARN. The student then has eight weeks to review the module and successfully achieve 75% to pass an academic integrity quiz.\r\n\r\nStudents who do not achieve 75% will have to retake the quiz until they attain the minimum score. Students who do not comply within the 8 weeks will be contacted by the Office of Academic Integrity and advised to complete the module within 14 days. Students who do not complete the module will not be allowed to enroll in future courses until they have completed this mandatory credit.",
