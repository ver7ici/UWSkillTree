    "description": "This course is an introduction to practical laboratory skills. Laboratory techniques will include: the separation, isolation and purification of compounds (through extraction, reflux, distillation, chromatography, and recrystallization), analysis techniques, and the application of these techniques in synthesis. The subjects covered in this biweekly laboratory provide the foundation for more advanced laboratory courses and the basic training needed for an industrial or research laboratory position. The seminar portion of this course will focus on communication and technical skills; the latter will include analysis of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), use of search engines, and learning of citation formats.
