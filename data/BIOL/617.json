    "description": "A critical evaluation of current research topics in environmental toxicology will be undertaken. Emphasis will be placed on the ecosystem approach to toxicology including cycling of toxicants, routes by which toxicants are removed from the environment and the impact of toxicants on species interaction within communities. Consideration will also be given to new methods for toxic hazard prediction and evaluation, as well as to biotic and abiotic factors that modify toxicant impact.",
