    "description": "The goal of the course is to introduce new graduate students in the department of Biology to the basic skills that will be necessary for them to acquire and organize information as well as present it effectively.  The course will be given in two sections, in different terms; Topic 1: Life Science Research Skills (fall of a student's first year) and Topic 2: Scientific presentation (winter of a student's second or third year).  The participants are expected to also attend and participate in the weekly \"Biology Brown Bag Gathering\" which is a forum for students and post doctoral fellows to present their research results or lead discussions on current topics of general interest.  This series will start each fall with a presentation on \"How to give a talk\".",
