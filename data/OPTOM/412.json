Each student chooses one, different, interesting case from his/her previous clinical experience. The student presents the case and answers questions related to the case and the patient's condition(s). Faculty discussants will direct the students in assessing the basic and clinical science features of the cases. Patient cases may be chosen from any aspect of optometric practice.",
