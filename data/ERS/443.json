    "description": "This field research course is designed to involve students in high level intensive research on the function and/or structure of ecosystems as they change because of successional and human processes. Students will normally undertake an experimental approach to an ecosystem-based problem and evaluation outcomes of their experiment or long-term data sets. The course will be focused on one ecosystem per offering, e.g. marine, aquatic, terrestrial forest, mountain. It is expected that the course will be off-campus at a field station or protected area within North America but there may be opportunities to deliver it outside of North America. When offered, the syllabus will provide details on exact location. [Note: Field trip fee normally $2500+HST; will not exceed $3125+HST.]",
