    "title": "ReWilding and Ecological Restoration",
    "description": "Focus is on restoration and conservation at landscape scale, including an emphasis on connectivity, reintroduction of keystone species, novel ecosystems, re-introduction of apex predators, herbivores, and omnivores.  Because ReWilding can be infused with various political agendas and ideologies, technocratic issues, policy ambitions, and governance issues, students can expect to experience a course focused on ecology and technical skills but contextualized and connected to the larger concepts of socioecological change and resilience.  There may be opportunities for field experiences.",
