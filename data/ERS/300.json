    "description": "This course provides an opportunity to learn and begin to apply systems-based tools in the context of an interdisciplinary research problem defined by the student in cooperation with the teaching-team. Students are provided with an introduction to the conceptual tools of systems thinking and resilience that help understand the dynamics of social change and social innovation. These conceptual tools will then be applied by students to provide a framework for interdisciplinary research and to develop a richer understanding of a case study of fostering social change and building adaptive capacity.",
