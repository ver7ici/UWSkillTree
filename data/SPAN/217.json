    "description": "This course will introduce and expose students to the Indigenous civilizations that embody the Americas. Students will look at the cosmogonies, histories, and cultures of Indigenous peoples from pre-Columbian times to the 20th century. They will analyze Latin America's Pueblos Originarios' perspectives on conquest, colonization, and independence, and compare such perspectives to those of First Nations and Native Americans. Through their study of colonial, social, economic, and political relations, students will examine how the meanings of these categories changed over time and how Indigenous peoples have contributed to the ethnically diverse regional societies that continue to characterize Latin America today.
