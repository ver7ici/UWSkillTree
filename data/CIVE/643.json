    "description": "This course examines the formulation, derivation, and application of theories associated with traffic flow on interrupted and uninterrupted road networks.  Topics include traffic stream characteristics, human factors, car following models, safety, energy and emissions, and traffic flows at signalised and unsignalised intersections. Theoretical models will be tested using field data and simulation.",
