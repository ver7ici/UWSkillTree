    "title": "Biological Wastewater Treatment: Theory and Practice",
    "description": "This course focuses on theory, modelling and application of microbiological processes that are being utilised in the treatment of wastewater.  A review of relevant concepts in microbiology will be followed by core principles that are used to assess contaminant removal kinetics and to model bioreactor performance.  These principles will be drawn upon in discussion of applications of biological wastewater treatment technologies.  If time permits, advanced topics including nonsteady-state systems and complex multispecies interactions will be introduced.",
