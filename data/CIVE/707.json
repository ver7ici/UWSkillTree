    "description": "This course deals with the science of heat and air flow, moisture storage and transport, and psychrometrics.  Through the use of worked examples, these principles are applied to the analysis of typical building enclosure systems. Basic concepts are developed for the design of building details that are effective in the control of heat, air, vapour, rain, and that accommodate building movements.  Various case studies of problems and solutions will be used.",
