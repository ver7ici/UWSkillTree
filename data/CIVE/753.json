    "description": "This course is designed to help students understand the fundamental principles and practical methods of geotechnical earthquake engineering. This course will present basic concepts of vibratory motion, dynamics, seismology, earthquakes, and strong ground motion, and introduces procedures of deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. Basic concepts of wave propagation are used to develop procedures for ground response analysis and to provide insight into such important problems as local site effects, seismic slope stability, and seismic design of retaining structures.",
